Hanawa ②: Takuya and Hanasaki

With Layla's return to the Mir Kingdom, Takuya's class now only consisted of Emily and Monica.  There would be no cultural festival, and their participation in the evening gathering was also cancelled.

Takuya spent his days participating in the volunteer activities Hanasaki assigned him, though his dissatisfaction with them remained unchanged.


One day, Hanasaki made a proposal to Takuya.


"Emily and Monica as direct subordinates?"

"Yes. We received word from the Mir Kingdom that Layla will not be returning to Japan.  If a foreign national assigned as a direct subordinate returns to their home country and doesn't return to Japan, the direct subordinate status is terminated."


Layla was removed from Takuya's direct subordinates.  This regulation meant the same applied to Emily and Monica.


"Emily and Monica haven't received orders to return home, have they?"

"No. We've heard from both of them that, if possible, they wish to remain with Takuya-sama after graduating high school."

"Really?!"

"Yes. However, this requires permission from both the Mir Kingdom and Japan."

"Huh?  Japan's permission?  There's a chance they won't accept Emily and Monica?"

"Yes. We cannot accept foreign nationals without any kind of screening."

"Is there a problem with Emily and Monica?"

"That will be determined during the screening process.  First, the Mir Kingdom needs to approve them living in Japan with Takuya-sama.  Regarding this… it's likely there will be no problem."


Regarding the illegal aphrodisiac case, Hanasaki had appealed to the Prime Minister to negotiate with the Mir Kingdom to allow Emily and Monica to continue living in Japan.


The investigation into the illegal aphrodisiac smuggling route was to identify a traitor within Japan.

Since Japan must continue trading with the Mir Kingdom, even exposing their wrongdoing requires a way to resolve the situation.

Hanasaki intended to use this resolution as leverage in the negotiations for Emily and Monica.

While a conclusion hasn't been reached, Hanasaki has been told by the Prime Minister it will likely be alright.  However, it seems they'll need to return to the Mir Kingdom temporarily.

Some kind of procedure will be carried out there.

It's said there won't be any harm to their lives or bodies, but if Emily and Monica even temporarily return to the Mir Kingdom, Takuya will undoubtedly be worried.


Emily and Monica are prospective members of the Mir Kingdom's shadowy organization.

Their mother, Tania, was a former slave.

Her high physical abilities led to her becoming a low-ranking royal family member, working within the shadowy organization.

Emily and Monica, as Tania's daughters, also lived as prospective members of the low-ranking royal family's shadowy organization.


The lowest-ranking royals are essentially expendable pawns.

All of them are former slaves, and they can be easily discarded if necessary.

In some cases, they are simply erased from existence as if they never existed.

Therefore, important information is never given to the lowest-ranking royals.

The information Emily and Monica possess is not considered important from the Mir Kingdom's perspective.

However, as a precaution, their memories related to the shadowy organization and the illegal aphrodisiacs will be erased.


Once the procedure is complete and they return to Japan, Emily and Monica will be able to live with Takuya.


(If only Takuya-sama's thoughts and personality were a little more… considerate of society… and women. He's quite unchanging. Men sent to the small world in the past showed similar tendencies.  Personalities formed by middle school age remain relatively unchanged.  A significant factor in determining a man's… a person's thoughts and personality, seems to be solidified by the time they reach middle school age.)


While not everyone is the same, the period from infancy to elementary and middle school is crucial for the development of a person's fundamental character.

In this world, boys are separated from their mothers when they start elementary school.  This is to prevent them from being overly influenced by their mothers, but what difference is there between boys who grow up lacking their mother's love and those who grow up with it?


(The special district of the small world managed by Yuuta is fascinating.  I wonder what results it will produce in the selection and development of men.)


From the administrator's perspective, the important thing is how to efficiently cultivate the limited number of men into socially useful individuals.

Yuuta's small world is nothing more than an experiment.  If the results are good, it will be utilized in the future; if not, it will simply be discarded.


(…Strange.  An administrator who doesn't empathize with anyone's heart, yet dedicates themselves to social stability and development… aims for the happiness of someone's heart.)


Hanasaki gazed gently at Takuya and said,


"Assuming we get permission from the Mir Kingdom, the problem lies with Japan's permission.  This involves Takuya-sama as well."

"Me?"

"Yes. Emily-san and Monica-san wish to live in Japan with Takuya-sama.  You would be their guarantor. With your current male rank at D-class… that would negatively impact the review."

"What?!  Th-then!  I just need to work harder at volunteer activities!"

"Yes.  We would be most grateful if Takuya-sama would… diligently perform volunteer work for society."

"Understood! Leave it to me! I'll take on any volunteer activity!"


Takuya is full of determination, but once he gets to his volunteer assignment, he might start complaining as usual.  Or perhaps, he might work diligently without a single complaint.


(Let's believe it's still uncertain. 'Men always work hard for the woman they love,' Lilith taught me. For Emily-san and Monica-san, Takuya-sama might change.)


If Takuya remains unchanged and graduates high school, he will be sent to the small world.

Emily and Monica would likely be sent there as well.

That might be a form of happiness in itself.

Hanasaki sincerely hopes that what awaits Takuya after his efforts is happiness.
