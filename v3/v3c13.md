Episode 13: The Sleeping Prince ②

Aoi and the others decided to take Yuuta to a hospital near Lilith's research facility at the genetics institute.

The drive took about three hours.

Inside the large, well-equipped medical vehicle, only Yuuta's quiet breathing could be heard.

Aoi, Yukishiro, and Manami were in the vehicle with Yuuta, while Tomoe was following in a separate car with Ayaka.

Tomoe and Ayaka exchanged detailed information about their class trip in the car, trailing behind Yuuta's vehicle.


"I really wonder why..."

Hearing Tomoe's words, Ayaka also questioned why Yuuta had suddenly lost consciousness.  They hadn't mentioned the incident.  Even after hearing about the events leading up to it, Yuuta seemed to have been enjoying the class trip.

He celebrated his birthday with everyone, became closer to Yukishiro, and they became a couple.  Although there was a meeting with Saori afterward, Yuuta didn't speak to her during the meeting itself.  After returning, he enjoyed interacting with everyone.  Then, while watching the fireworks, his complexion worsened, and he lost consciousness.


Their schedule had taken Yuuta's workload into consideration, but perhaps he'd accumulated fatigue without realizing it. However, if it were just fatigue, it wouldn't explain why he remained unconscious for over a week.


Upon arriving at the hospital near Lilith's research facility, they moved Yuuta to a private room to allow him to rest.  Shortly after Aoi and the others arrived, Nanase and the Boss showed up.

Nanase, arriving before the Boss, updated Yukishiro on the progress of the negotiations with Minato.


"The main points are settled; we're now working on the details."
"Thank you."
"The remaining problem is whether Saori-sama will accept Yukishiro-san as Yuuta-sama's second wife and the next head of the family."
"Yes…"
"Don't worry. Yuuta-sama will surely awaken."


Nanase encouraged Yukishiro, who had a grave expression.  Nanase believed she was the only one who could lighten the somber mood, so she offered words of encouragement not only to Yukishiro but also to Aoi and Manami.  Although her words lacked any concrete basis, Aoi's and the others' hearts felt slightly lighter.


"I'd like to schedule another meeting with Saori-sama in August, but perhaps it's best to wait until Yuuta-sama awakens."

Yukishiro firmly grasped her fan at Nanase's words and spoke with resolve.


"I want the meeting with my mother to proceed as planned."
"Are you sure?"
"Yes. When Yuuta-sama awakens, I want everything to be resolved, rather than leaving problems outstanding."
"I see…Understood.  Then, we'll adjust the schedule for the meeting with Saori-sama as soon as preparations are complete."
"Thank you."


After Nanase and Yukishiro's conversation, the Boss arrived at the hospital. Everyone gathered in the room next to Yuuta's private room.  Yukishiro wasn't particularly surprised to hear about the memory manipulation since she had also learned that the organization's boss was Japan's Deputy Prime Minister.

Without much preamble, the newly arrived Boss began to speak.


"As Ayaka-san already explained, I want to have Lilith-san examine Yuuta-sama at her research facility. I again strongly requested that Aoi-sama and the others be present during the examination, but the answer remains the same."


Even after coming this far, Aoi and the others couldn't hide their disappointment and anxiety at the Boss's words.  Nanase spoke up.


"Lilith-san is affiliated with the organization, isn't she?"
"Yes."
"But she doesn't follow the orders of the organization's boss."
"Regarding this, I have permission to disclose information from the Prime Minister. Lilith-san is affiliated with the organization because she was introduced by the Prime Minister."
"The Prime Minister…"
"Lilith-san is a scientist with strong connections to the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials.  She doesn't simply follow my orders as the organization's boss."


The Boss's words confirmed that they couldn't control Lilith. This fact only increased their anxieties.


"Then the reliability of the words Lilith-san said to you is nonexistent."

Nanase said in a strong tone.  While the organization had a friendly relationship with them, they didn't trust everything about it, especially regarding Yuuta.


"The Prime Minister is aware of this matter. He instructed Lilith-san to examine Yuuta-sama and do her best to restore his consciousness.  I have received assurances that nothing of the sort that Yoshiwara's people fear will happen."
"Is that so?"
"Here's the written document."


Even hearing it was from the Prime Minister of Japan, they couldn't be sure if it was true.  Nanase looked at the document the Boss presented and believed it to be a genuine Prime Ministerial seal.  However, thinking about the possibility of it being forged led to an endless loop.

Ideally, Nanase wished to meet the Prime Minister and Lilith in person and have Lilith receive instructions in front of them. But that would be incredibly rude to the Prime Minister of Japan.  For the country, Yuuta was valuable, but ultimately, just one man. Making excessive requests and having them refused would only cause problems for Aoi and the others.  In essence, Lilith examining Yuuta was a gesture of goodwill from the government. Aoi and the others were in the position of asking for a favor.


"Aoi-san, what do you say?"
"…"


Nanase asked Aoi to make the decision.


"We'll have Lilith-san… examine Yuuta-sama."
"Then tomorrow, let's transfer Yuuta-sama to Lilith-san's research facility.  We can handle the transfer to the research facility, correct?"
"Yes. Lilith-san contacted us and said she's fine with meeting Aoi-sama and the others during Yuuta-sama's transfer. Will you meet her?"
"Yes! Please."
"Understood.  I'll arrange it."


Afterwards, they shared information about Yuuta with the Boss and Nanase. Everyone present shared the same feeling: to ensure Yuuta's safe awakening.





At a hotel not far from the hospital where Yuuta was staying, high-ranking members of the royal family from the Meal Kingdom were staying for the negotiations.  Leila and Seira were also staying at the hotel to take care of them.


The negotiations with Japan had largely concluded last night.  Lila had confirmed that the creation of the Old World male had failed.  It seemed that even more advanced genetic engineering techniques existed than those currently provided to the Meal Kingdom.  They had secured Lilith's agreement to examine Her Majesty directly. For now, it should satisfy Her Majesty.


From this hotel, they could see the Japanese Genetics Institute and Lilith's research facility. For the Meal Kingdom, it was most important for Lila to verify Japan's top-secret project; therefore, they stayed at a hotel near the Genetics Institute.


"How about some sightseeing?  There's no need to return immediately."

Seira, having been told by a high-ranking member of the royal family to prepare for their immediate return to the Meal Kingdom after the negotiations with Japan, said something insincere. Although she wanted them to leave as soon as possible, Seira, who was in a precarious position because of her and her daughter's mistakes being discovered by Japan, put on a smile and pretended to be considerate.  Leila wasn't as good as Seira at managing her expressions and couldn't hide her joy that the high-ranking royals, who treated them like servants, were leaving.


"It feels suffocating in this country. Get ready quickly."

A woman who was one of the negotiators ordered Seira and Leila condescendingly.  She was the one who had sent them to this country for three years, and ordered the investigation of Japan's top-secret project delaying their return. Both Seira and Leila were furious inside.


"Oh, and from now on, there's no need to conduct surveillance on Japan's top-secret project. Return to your original duties."
"Th-that is…"
"Understood?"
"…Yes, ma'am."


Bowing respectfully, Seira and Leila began preparing for the royals' departure.









However, the next day, among the high-ranking members of the royal family who were trying to return to the Meal Kingdom as soon as possible, a woman always wearing a hood, known as Lila, called for Seira.  Seira thought something troublesome was coming and took her daughter, Leila, with her.  Leila grumbled the usual complaint, "Why me?!" as she followed.


"Good morning."
"Delay my return."
"Eh?"


Seira and Leila couldn't believe their ears at the unexpected words.  They had heard her say, "Delay my return."


"Delay your return?"
"That's what I said."
"Y-yes, ma'am. Will it just be Lila-sama?"
"Yes."
"When will you be returning?"


Wanting them to go home quickly, Seira asked when their return would be, not how long they would stay.


"I'll be here until my business is finished.  I don't know when I'll return."
"What's your business?"
"It's none of your concern."
"Y-yes. W-well, while you're staying, I'll have my daughter Leila attend to you. Please tell Leila if you need anything."
"Eh!?"
"Understood."


Seira left the room quickly, handing Leila over to Lila, saying she had to attend to the other royals' departure preparations. She gestured for Leila to follow her eyes.


Leila was very unhappy with Seira's order, but if she didn't take care of Lila, she'd just be taking care of the departing royals.  Seira thought that once the royals' departure was over, Lila would come to her for this, so she calmed her anger.


"Would you like something to drink?"
"Coffee."
"Yes, ma'am."


Having nothing else to do, she made coffee for Lila.  Lila kept staring at the Institute from the window.  After quickly brewing the coffee and placing it on the table, Leila also looked at the Institute from the window.


"Is there something wrong?"
"Oh, something interesting is happening."


Lila drank the coffee placed on the table.


"This is terrible."
"S-sorry."
"It seems difficult to find men here. If you have nothing to do, try to make better coffee."
"I-I will improve."


While drinking the bad coffee, Lila remembered that the girl in front of her had used an aphrodisiac prohibited in Japan.


"Oh, right, it was you. You were the one who brought out the aphrodisiac, weren't you?"
"Yes…I'm sorry."
"So you were able to find men here. How were the men in Japan?"


Seeing that Lila didn't seem to intend to scold her, Leila began to talk about how she had enjoyed herself with Takuya and the men she had gathered through him.  She also mentioned that Emi and Monica were fond of Takuya.


"Oh my. That's quite interesting."
"Interesting?"
"Yes. I wonder what it is about Takuya that attracted you.  I'd like to meet him and ask him."
"Shall I call him?"


Leila hoped that she wouldn't have to leave Emi and Monica to take care of Lila, but...


"No, it's fine. Let him be with Takuya for now.  I'll ask him when we're back in the Meal Kingdom."
"Y-yes."
"Were you not attracted to the men in Japan?"
"I, I…"


Leila blushed at Lila's question.


"You weren't interested in Takuya, were you?"
"That's right. I'm not interested in Takuya-sama."
"Then it must be a different man.  Why didn't you seduce him?"
"When I seduced Takuya-sama, I didn't know about him yet."
"You didn't know about him?"
"Yes. Due to a certain incident when I was in the first year of junior high school, I became a hikikomori (shut-in) for a long time. Therefore, I never had the chance to get to know him."
"Oh. So you were attracted to that shut-in?"
"He seems to have started actively participating in society towards the end of his third year of junior high school. The first time I met him was at the night party of last year's cultural festival."
"To be attracted to the first man you meet is unusual."
"Yes! He was unlike any other man I had ever seen! The way he showed consideration for women…"
"Oh, consideration for women?"
"Yes! Not only consideration…"


Perhaps it was just a pastime for Lila.  She decided to act at night.


Leila found it enjoyable to talk about the ideal Yuuta-sama she had created in her mind, and she talked about things Lila hadn't asked about.  Her story was mixed with fantasies.  In Leila's story, Aoi was a villain.


"I see. The succubus suit that brought about change in Japan for the past year. Yuuta was the first to use it, wasn't he?"
"That's right… Yuuta-sama."


Leila felt annoyed when Lila addressed Yuuta casually.  She was probably screaming in her heart, "Don't call my Yuuta-sama by his first name!"


How long had she been talking to Lila?  When Leila looked out the window at the Institute again…


"Hmm?"


She saw several cars leaving the Institute. One of them was a particularly large vehicle.
