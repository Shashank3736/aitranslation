Episode 14: The Sleeping Prince ③

Aoi and the others moved Yuta to Lilith's research facility.

After laying Yuta down on the bed in the designated innermost room, they met with Lilith in a separate room.

They asked Lilith several questions, but her answers were cold and dismissive.


“Even if I explained, you wouldn't understand. And I don't intend to explain.”


They received no answers to any of their questions.  If Aoi and the others showed anger, Lilith coldly replied, "If you don't like it, you can take him back."

Seeing this, their boss intervened, and Lilith offered a forced smile, saying, "I will properly examine Yuta-sama."


Aoi and the others left the facility, hugging the sleeping Yuta and shedding tears.


They tried to stay at the hotel closest to the research facility, but it was fully booked by the Meiru Kingdom's delegation.  They ended up staying at the next closest hotel.

Lilith's examination of Yuta might not be finished in a single day.  Lilith had said it might take several days.  She promised to update them daily on his condition.


Aoi, Manami, and Yukishiro were gathered in their room, talking.  Being alone only increased their anxiety.  Just being together helped calm them down.  Yukishiro made them delicious milk tea, and they discussed things while drinking it.


The conversation turned to the Meiru Kingdom's hotel booking. They knew that Leila and her companions were still directly under Takuya's command.  Aoi and Yukishiro were unaware of what happened to Takuya's class afterward.  Yukishiro’s direct subordination to Takuya ended on March 31st of that year, and Akari and the others had also all left his service.  Yukishiro's heart was moving forward towards becoming Yuta's wife, and she no longer looked back at Takuya.


Meanwhile, Manami was gathering information.


"It seems Emili and Monica are living normal lives in Takuya-sama's class.  However, Leila doesn't seem to attend Takuya-sama's class much."

"For Leila-san, Takuya-sama was merely a tool to use Minato's money through Yukishiro-san.  It's actually more surprising that Emili and Monica are attending Takuya-sama's class and living normal lives."

"True. Is it Leila's instruction?"


Aoi and Yukishiro no longer cared about Leila or Takuya. Aoi was still angry at Leila for hurting Yukishiro, but they would no longer be involved with her.  Yukishiro was walking a happy path with Yuta.  Yukishiro's happiness would be the most painful thing for both Takuya and Leila.


"Apparently, there were very high-ranking royals in the Meiru Kingdom delegation."

"It's probably a discussion to increase the export of rare metals to Nihon."

"For the production of succubus suits and dildos, right?"

"Most likely. Yoshiwara has also ordered a considerable amount of rare metals from the country for the construction of its theme park."


Yoshiwara's theme park under construction... Inma Land.  If all goes well, it's scheduled to open before winter this year.  A significant amount of rare metals is needed for the final stages of construction.


"Sigh... I hope he wakes up tomorrow."


No matter what they talked about, the conversation always returned to Yuta. Yuta had been the center of their lives, and now there was a gaping hole in that center.  Filled with anxiety, they talked late into the night before finally falling asleep.




Meanwhile,

At the hotel closest to Lilith's research facility, most of the Meiru Kingdom's delegation, including the royal family members, were scheduled to depart the next day.  Leila, who had been assigned to care for Rira, who had extended her stay, was changing into her nightclothes, preparing for bed.  Rira was someone she could understand.  Initially, she thought Rira had an arrogant personality typical of a high-ranking royal, but it seemed she just maintained the same demeanor towards everyone. Leila was relieved; taking care of Rira wouldn't be too exhausting.


"Eh?"


Looking out the window, she saw Rira walking alone.  Even in the heat of summer, Rira was wearing her hood— unmistakably her.


"Wh-what's going on!?"


As someone tasked by Seira to look after Rira, any strange actions on Rira's part would become her responsibility. And the direction she was heading was towards the research facility.


Leila, still in her negligee, hurried after Rira.  Fortunately, it was late at night and there were few people around, so she could catch up to Rira before she reached the research facility.


"R-Rira-sama!"

"Hm? You.  Why are you here?"

"That's what I want to ask! Don't go out alone at night! What if something happens?"

"What could happen? Nothing."

"No, it's not about that..."

"I'm just running a quick errand. You can go back."

"If something were to happen to Rira-sama, it would be my responsibility! Besides, what kind of errand is it? At this hour?"


Rira continued walking, ignoring Leila's words.  The research facility was just ahead.


"Rira-sama! Please come back. If you have business at the research facility, do it tomorrow."

"It's better at night because no one will see me. Besides, they're waiting for me."

"They?"

"Everyone has been dismissed, so it's fine."


They reached the research facility, where the gate was naturally closed.  They couldn't enter the premises.


"Eh!?"


As Rira approached the gate, a clicking sound echoed as the automatic lock disengaged. Rira entered without hesitation.


"R-Rira-sama!"


Leila followed helplessly.  How did the gate open? And what did she mean by everyone having been dismissed?


"Rira-sama, are you being invited by someone?"

"I'm not being invited. I just came in."

"But you just said they were waiting..."

"Ah. Don't worry about it."


It was nonsensical, but Rira kept moving forward. They arrived at the front of Lilith's research facility.


(Will the automatic lock unlock again?)


Just as Leila thought that, Rira placed her finger on the fingerprint scanner of the automatic door.  The door unlocked, recognizing her fingerprint.


"Eh?"

"Since you've come this far, you might as well come with me. I have something I want to confirm after hearing your story."


Inside Lilith's research facility, only a few lights were on.  They moved through the dim interior, unlocking several automatic doors with Rira's fingerprint.  The large automatic door at the very back required both fingerprint and retinal scanning, but Rira unlocked it as well.  A light was on in the room beyond.


"You came."


Inside was a woman wearing a similar hood to Rira's.  Someone seemed to be asleep in the bed in the room.


"Did you bring a guest?"

"She followed me after seeing me come here. Consider it fate."

"Hmm, fate."


The woman in the hood showed no interest in Leila, not reproaching her.  Leila didn't understand what was going on as she listened to the two women's conversation.


"Is she a compatible subject?"

"I came here today. You'd notice right away."

"Of course. I knew when she was brought here."


While listening to the conversation, Leila moved slightly to try and see the face of the person sleeping on the bed.


"What's spread across Nihon, are the compatible subjects...?"

"That's right."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"It's not something that can be discussed there."

"I suppose not."


Leila gently peeked at the face of the person sleeping in the bed.  It was…


"What!?"


It was Yuta.


"Wh-why is Yuta-sama here!?"

"Ah, so that's it. The man you were talking about is this man, right?"

"Y-yes. That's right."

"What about that child?"

"Don't worry about it. She seems to know the compatible subject."


Leila's emotions surged. Because of Aoi’s hateful interference, she thought she’d never see Yuta again, but now she could.  Leila rushed to the bed.


"Ah, Yuta-sama ♡"


Leila gazed lovingly at Yuta, sleeping on the bed.


"Why is Yuta-sama sleeping? Why is he here?"


And the question of why Yuta was here, why he was sleeping...


"It's a shame he wasn't Adam."

"That's true."


Leila's question was ignored, and Rira uttered the unfamiliar word, "Adam."


"What about the compatible subject's soul? Can we increase it by creating a clone body?"

"Impossible."

"Did you discard it?"

"No. I used it all for the fusion."

"All of it? What a waste."

"It's a difference in thinking. Otherwise, it won't succeed."


Ignoring the unanswered question, Leila decided to ignore their nonsensical conversation.  It was Yuta who mattered.  She gently grasped Yuta's right hand.


"Ah ♡"


It was soft, smooth, and warm.  She held his hand again and again.


"Was the difference in our thinking a difference from the initial design phase?"

"I wonder. It's recognized that they acquire individuality in the self-learning process."


Leila was no longer listening to their conversation.  She was captivated by the feeling of Yuta's hand.  She brought his right hand to her cheek, moving it as if he were caressing her.


(Ah ♡ Yuta-sama is caressing me ♡)


With a completely crazed expression, she reveled in the touch of Yuta's hand.  She kissed his fingers.


"Mwah ♡"


Once she kissed him, her crazed instinct couldn't be stopped. She began licking Yuta's fingers. It was fortunate for Yuta that it wasn't his left hand, the one with the ring Aoi had given him.


Leila licked Yuta's hand while Lilith and Rira continued their conversation.  They showed no interest in Leila's actions or concern for Yuta, whose hand she was licking. Thinking her actions were acceptable, Leila reached for Yuta's groin.


(Aah ♡)


She gently stroked Yuta's groin.  In VR games, in fantasies, Yuta always relentlessly tormented Leila.  And now it was right in front of her.


(Yuta-sama ♡ Yuta-sama ♡ Yuta-sama ♡)


As she gently stroked his penis, it gradually reacted.  Yuta's groin began to swell.


(He's feeling it ♡  Yuta-sama still only wants me ♡ Only I can please Yuta-sama ♡)


Pleased by Yuta's arousal, Leila moved her mouth, which had been sucking his hand, towards Yuta's face.  She was about to steal a kiss from the sleeping Yuta...


"Oi."


Rira called out, stopping her.  She was disappointed to be interrupted from her enjoyment but didn't defy Rira. Her crazed instinct hadn't yet fully taken over.


"You, try sucking it."

"Eh?"


But Rira's words were unexpected.  Suck it.  Suck what? There was only one answer.


"You were going to watch his reaction anyway, weren't you?"


Rira said to Lilith.


"That's right."


As Rira said, Lilith intended to observe Yuta's reaction upon ejaculation.  It only mattered whether Lilith would handle it or Leila would suck it.  Lilith, with an emotionless expression, told Leila.


"Make Yuta-sama ejaculate."
