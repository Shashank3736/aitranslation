Episode 19: The Crying Princess ①

Yukishiro, in Minato's private room for the first time in a while, sipped the milk tea Lirika had made.

Nanase had informed Saori that she would pick up Yukishiro tomorrow evening, and Saori had agreed, so Nanase had returned to Yoshiwara.


Although Yukishiro had met Lirika many times at Yuuta's mansion in Yoshiwara, being cared for by her in her own room was still a pleasant experience.

Lirika always kept Yukishiro's room clean and tidy, ensuring it was ready for her return at any time.

After expressing her gratitude to Lirika again, Yukishiro rested in her room until her meeting with Saori.


Lirika also knew about Yuuta's collapse.  Aかり (Akari), who had been on the class trip, had conveyed the news.


"Is that so? He hasn't woken up yet?"

"Yes. Everyone is going through anxious days."


Yukishiro avoided giving specific details, only mentioning that Yuuta remained unconscious.  She couldn't bring herself to reveal the impending meeting between Yuuta and Suzune, the one who caused the incident.


"I'm sure Yuuta-sama will wake up.  If we resolve this matter beforehand, he'll be pleased."

"Yes…  Lirika, there's something I want to ask you."

"Yes? What is it?"

"My mother attended the Holy Night Festival every year, didn't she?"

"Yes."

"And Ena-san… she attended too, right?"

"My mother? I've heard that."


Lirika, too, had heard that Saori and Ena attended the Holy Night Festival.


"Lirika, this might be a strange request, but could you ask Kayane-neesama as well?"

"My older sister?  You want me to ask her if Mother attended the Holy Night Festival with Saori-sama?"

"Yes, please."


Kayane is Ena's eldest daughter. Lirika is the second daughter.  Kayane, two years older than Lirika, has succeeded Ena.  She will likely participate in tomorrow's meeting.


Kayane, who inherited Ena's position four years ago at the young age of 20 after Ena's death at 40, had faced immense hardship at the time, as she was on the verge of marriage to a man she'd been seeing.  Four years have passed, and now 24, Kayane is already a mother of two.


Even though Kayane was going through the most difficult time after inheriting from Ena, she didn't call Lirika back home.  She understood that Lirika, her second daughter, preferred to be by Yukishiro's side rather than live the life of a noblewoman.  Kayane told Lirika to support Yukishiro and Minato instead of her family.


The sisters had a good relationship. Lirika contacted Kayane immediately.


"Ah, older sister, it's Lirika. Yes… yes…  Yukishiro-sama is with me now. Yes… she's back in Minato's private room."


Kayane expressed concern for Yukishiro's well-being upon receiving Lirika's call.  It seemed she would indeed attend tomorrow's meeting.


"I called because I wanted to ask you something.  My mother… my mother attended the Holy Night Festival with Saori-sama before she passed, right?"


Kayane's answer was the same. She said that Ena should have attended.  When asked why Lirika was asking, Lirika explained that Yukishiro wanted to know.


"Eh? Oh, I understand. I'll look into it."


After hanging up with Kayane, Lirika told Yukishiro with a surprised expression.


"My sister… said she would ask Father."

"Lirika-san's father?!"

"Yes…  When Mother died, my sister wasn't married yet. She didn't have the opportunity to attend the Holy Night Festival with Mother.  My sister had heard that Mother attended the Holy Night Festival with Saori-sama, but she hadn't confirmed it."

"I see."

"When I told her that Yukishiro-sama had asked, she said that Father is the only one who knows the truth, so she would ask him."


The Holy Night Festival is an event attended by couples or lovers. If Ena went to the festival, her husband must have known something.


"Ah."


Lirika's phone rang.  Seeing the caller ID, she answered immediately.


"M-m-moshi moshi, this is Lirika! O-oh, Father!"


Less than ten minutes after finishing her call with Kayane, she received a call from her father.


"Yes… yes… that's right… yes… I understand."


Lirika held the phone out to Yukishiro.


"Yukishiro-sama, it's Father."

"…Yes."


Yukishiro took the phone from Lirika.


"Moshi moshi, this is Yukishiro. It's been a while, Haruto-sama."


Haruto Souma. Ena's husband and Lirika's father.  He's the same age as Ena, 44 this year.


(Haruto): "It's been a long time. Kayane told me a bit about it. I was worried."

(Yukishiro): "I'm sorry for causing you concern and trouble."

(Haruto): "Don't worry about that. Now, you're asking if Ena attended the Holy Night Festival with Saori, right?"

(Yukishiro): "Yes."

(Haruto): "This question means you have doubts, doesn't it?"

(Yukishiro): "Yes. I'm currently under the protection of Nanase-sama of Yoshiwara.  During our conversations, Nanase-sama said she never saw my mother at the Holy Night Festival."

(Haruto): "I see. If you're talking to Nanase-sama of Yoshiwara, that would be the case."

(Yukishiro): "My mother didn't attend the Holy Night Festival?"

(Haruto): "Ah, Saori didn't attend the Holy Night Festival, and neither did Ena."

(Yukishiro): "Then why did people say she attended? Where was she that day?"

(Haruto): "If Ena were alive, I don't know what she would say.  Since she's gone, I'll tell you what I know."

(Yukishiro): "Please."

(Haruto): "On the day of the Holy Night Festival, she would go near the venue by car every year. I was in the car with Ena. Saori… was waiting alone in the car."

(Yukishiro): "Waiting? For… Father?"

(Haruto): "Yes. She was waiting for Hiroto-kun."


Hiroto Mochizuki. The name of the man who married Saori. He's five years older than Saori, 41 this year.


(Haruto): "But… Hiroto-kun never came."

(Yukishiro): "Did Father refuse to attend the Holy Night Festival?"

(Haruto): "I don't know. Ena never told me.  She would cry and apologize every year.  I thought there must be some deep reason, so I didn't pry.  So now, I don't know the truth."


Haruto has two other wives besides Ena, and also a lover.  After Ena's death, he could have attended the Holy Night Festival with his other wives or lover, but he didn't feel like it, so he didn't attend for the past four years. Therefore, he doesn't know what Saori was doing on the day of the Holy Night Festival.


(Yukishiro): "From Ena, I heard that my mother and father's relationship was neither good nor bad, just ordinary.  Have you ever heard anything about that, Haruto-sama?"

(Haruto): "No, not really. Ena rarely told me about Saori and Hiroto-kun."


Ena probably wouldn't have talked about the affairs of her master, even to her husband.


(Yukishiro): "I see… Thank you for telling me."

(Haruto): "I hear things are tough for you.  Kayane is probably settling down a bit, so if you have any trouble, rely on her."

(Yukishiro): "Yes, thank you."

(Haruto): "Can you let Lirika take the phone?"

(Yukishiro): "Yes."


Lirika takes the phone from Yukishiro and continues talking to her father for a while.


(Lirika's thoughts): *Mother was waiting for Father at the Holy Night Festival venue, but he never came.*


Hiroto, Saori's husband, was made to create and act out a non-existent love story by the previous head of the Minato family.  Yukishiro has no memories of her father, but she was taught by those around her that he was a gentle and kind man.  She believed that even though she didn't know him, her father was a gentle and kind man.  That's why, during her first interaction with boys in elementary school (6th grade), she was disappointed to find that they were rough and violent, unlike the gentle father she had imagined.  Compared to the gentle father she had never met.


(Yukishiro's thoughts): *(Was it because the gentleness I sought was present in Yuuta's voice that I was naturally healed by it?  Yuuta-sama made the fantasy I had created from the words "kind father," whom I cannot meet, a reality.)*


That's why, Yukishiro wondered, was she so drawn to Yuuta?


(Yukishiro's thoughts): *(What kind of man is my real father?  And Mother…)*


As she was lost in thought, there was a knock on the door.


"Yukishiro-sama. Please come to the head of the family's room."


It was time for her meeting with Saori.




Lirika and Yukishiro arrived at Saori's room, the head of the family.  Lirika waits outside. Yukishiro knocks on the door.


"Mother. It's Yukishiro."

"Come in."


Yukishiro smiles at Lirika and enters the room. This room holds many memories, both good and bad.  Two chairs are placed in front of a low table in the tatami room.  Saori sits in one of them.


"Sit down."

"Yes."


Yukishiro sits opposite Saori.  Saori immediately begins to discuss the main topic.


"We will make you Yuuta-sama's second wife and the next head of Minato. The joint venture with Yoshiwara…"


This wasn't a mother-daughter conversation.  It was a preliminary coordination for tomorrow's meeting, where the heads of the prominent families supporting Minato would recognize Yukishiro as Yuuta's second wife, the next head of Minato.  Saori calmly explained the events so far and the key points.  Her demeanor was different from the Saori Yukishiro knew.  Even after losing Ena, Saori had admirably fulfilled her duties as the head of Minato.  But the Saori before her now felt different.


"That's all. Do you have any questions?"

"…Mother."


At Yukishiro's voice, Saori finally looked at her daughter.  Until now, Saori hadn't looked at Yukishiro, only speaking unilaterally.


"Mother, do you approve of me becoming Yuuta-sama's second wife?"

"I told you I approved at the beginning. And… you're already bound to Yuuta-sama, so there's nothing else I can do.  Iori wouldn't be able to manage it."

"I'll rephrase my question. As a mother, can you bless your daughter's marriage?"


Saori's grip on her fan tightens at Yukishiro's question.


"…Do you need my blessing? You've already bound yourself to Yuuta-sama without asking me, and now you're asking for your mother's blessing?"

"I'm sorry for binding myself to Yuuta-sama without consulting you, Mother. But I've decided to be true to my heart. Rather than devoting myself to a man chosen for me by you, I want to be with the man I desire."


The sound of her gripping the fan resonates even louder.  Without consulting her mother and the head of the family, Saori, Yukishiro had become Yuuta's lover. Saori is partly responsible for Yukishiro's actions. If she criticizes Yukishiro for binding herself to Yuuta, Saori tried to marry Yukishiro off to a man she didn't even know.  Just as she had done to Yukishiro.


"Mother… I truly fell in love with Yuuta-sama.  When I heard Yuuta-sama's voice… the ideal of a gentle man in my heart became a reality."

"So, you had feelings for Yuuta-sama since you interacted with Takuya-sama?"

"If I'm honest with my heart, yes.  But when I interacted with Takuya-sama, my feelings for Yuuta-sama were suppressed.  I was never interacting with Takuya-sama while having feelings for Yuuta-sama. At that time, I was wholeheartedly trying to deepen my relationship with Takuya-sama."

"As a result, your relationship with Takuya-sama ended, and you chose to become the second wife of the man who will have the Yoshiwara daughter as his first wife.  Do you have any idea how difficult it was to get the heads of the prominent families supporting Minato to agree to this!"

"I am grateful. But more than anything, I want your blessing, Mother."


Saori's irritation grows at her daughter's direct gaze.


"Yuuta-sama… answered my feelings. Mother… Mother, won't you bless your daughter's love marriage?"

“…”


Saori must have wanted this. She wanted her daughter, Yukishiro, to achieve what she hadn't. She must have been happy to see Iori and Katsuya together.


"Yuuta-sama is a man who will have Aoi-san of Yoshiwara as his first wife. I'm sorry that Minato's head of the family will become his second wife and that it brings shame to the family.  But even so, we fell in love and became bound. Even if there are things you can't forgive as the head of Minato, can't you bless us as a mother?"

“…”


Even if Saori secretly hated Nanase and Yoshiwara, her daughter Yukishiro had fallen in love and become bound to a man. Saori's wish had come true.




"Excuse me."




Amid the heavy silence, a voice is heard from outside the room. A woman who had entered the room brought tea.  Two cups of tea are placed on the table.


"Ah…"

"Akari is being looked after."

"I am too…  I'm always helped by Akari."


The woman who brought the tea was Akari's mother.


"I have been looked after at the Minato main residence since July."

"Is that so…"

"Please drink it while it's warm. It's made with Ena-san's favorite tea leaves."

"Yes."

"Then, excuse me."


Akari's mother bows to Yukishiro and Saori, then leaves with a gentle smile.  Saori and Yukishiro realized they had started talking before the tea was brought.  She must have been waiting outside because she had missed the opportunity to bring it in.


Saori took a sip of the tea made with Ena's favorite tea leaves, then, in a completely different tone from before, said to Yukishiro in a tired, listless voice:


"Once you marry Yuuta-sama… immediately take the seat of the head of the family."

"What?!"


In other words, Saori said she would relinquish her position as the head of Minato to Yukishiro next year. It was too soon.  Once Yukishiro marries Yuuta, she will have children.  That will be after Yukishiro turns 20.  It will take several years until the children are old enough.


Saori became head of the family at the age of 27.  That was quite young. In Saori's case, it was also due to Nanase becoming the head of Yoshiwara.


"If I'm here, Yuuta-sama will dislike coming to the Minato mansion. If Yukishiro becomes the head of the family, I'll move to a separate residence with Iori.  I'll help with the duties of the head of the family until Yukishiro's children grow up."

"Yuuta-sama will not dislike Mother!  He said he wants to get along with Mother too!"


Saori had acted correctly as the head of Minato.  Even if Yukishiro married Yuuta, there was no problem with Saori remaining head of the family.  There was no reason to rush Yukishiro into the position.


"I… am tired."

"Eh?"

"I'm tired of being the head of Minato."

"Mother…"


The feeling of unease Yukishiro had felt since entering the room.  Saori's behavior was strange.


"Mother… what happened?"

“…”


There was no answer to Yukishiro's question. Instead, she said…


"That's all.  Leave."


The meeting ended before the tea Akari's mother brought could get cold.
