Episode 20: The Sleeping Prince ⑧

That night, after Yukishiro returned to Minato's mansion, Aoi and the others were at Lilith's research facility, as permitted.  Their purpose was to keep Leila away from Yuuta.

Tonight, not only Yukishiro, but also Tomoe and Ayaka were absent.  They were scheduled to meet Suzune tomorrow, so they were given the night off.

Aoi and Manami were stationed outside the innermost room of the research facility where Yuuta slept.  Their goal was simply to prevent Leila from entering.

At 9 PM, as expected, Lila arrived at the research facility, with Leila trailing behind. Lila's fingerprint unlocked the entrance. Leila questioned when Lila's fingerprint was registered, but her priority was seeing Yuuta.  As the door opened, Leila attempted to follow Lila inside.

"Please wait."

A woman stood guard at the entrance.

"Please proceed, Lila-sama. Your attendant will wait here."

"What?!"

This was the facility entrance, not even near Yuuta's room.  Ordered to wait outside, Leila flew into a rage.

"Why?! I'm Lila-sama's attendant!"

"If assistance is needed inside, we will arrange it. Please wait here, Leila-san."

"Wh-what? You…"

Leila recognized the woman who stopped her.  Initially, she thought she was a facility staff member, but she wasn't wearing a uniform and seemed too young – about Leila's age.

While Leila tried to recall who the woman was, Lila calmly walked deeper into the facility. The woman didn't stop her.

"Li-Lila-sama!"

"Please wait here, Leila-san."

"Wh-what is this?! You… you're not a facility staff member. I've seen you somewhere…"

The woman, understanding Leila didn't recognize her, greeted her.

"We've met once, though I didn't formally introduce myself then. I'm Moe, subservient to Yuuta-sama's class. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"Ah! You were at the night party!"

Leila remembered the woman as the third woman who danced with Yuuta at the night party.

"You're also going to obstruct me."

"Obstruct…?  You are Lila-sama's attendant, correct? We'll handle any assistance needed inside, so we're not obstructing you; rather, we're helping."

"So why are you taking over Lila-sama's care?! It's my job!"

"Lila-sama proceeded without saying anything.  That means she doesn't mind if it's not you attending to her, right?"

Moe's words intensified Leila's frustration. However, her position was merely Lila's attendant.  As Lila hadn't brought her along, Leila was speechless.

"So you're Aoi-san's lackey, just like Manami-san."

"…I'm different from Manami-sama. Someone like me could never be in the same position as Manami-sama.  You can call me a lackey, but stop speaking ill of Manami-sama. She is the person Aoi-sama trusts most."

"Humph!  A woman without ambition.  Are you even from a noble family?! Shouldn't you strive to rise higher? Don't you want to surpass Manami-san and gain Yuuta-sama's favor?"

Leila's words momentarily stunned Moe.

(So, it's natural she doesn't know.)

"You needn't worry. All of us subservient to Yuuta-sama's class prioritize Yuuta-sama and Aoi-sama's good relationship, and also hope for a good relationship with Manami-sama. Besides, I'm not from a noble family."

"What?"

Not a noble family?  This unexpected response stunned Leila.

"Not a noble family… you…"

"I'm a commoner."

"What!?"

In Japan, there's a class distinction between noble families and commoners, a fluid distinction.  Even commoners can gain noble status by becoming a man's wife or lover and bearing children.  Conversely, nobles can lose their status if they fail to do so.

In the Meer Kingdom, the classes are royalty and slaves; there's no middle class. Only royalty can meet the men who are allowed to freely interact with the people. Slaves are merely the workforce that supports society.

If Leila loses her royal status due to causing trouble in Japan, she'll become a slave. This means not only losing access to men, but also falling from the ruling class to spend her life as a laborer.

In the Meer Kingdom, royal status is mainly determined by lineage.  Although some slaves may be welcomed into the royal family with the Queen's approval, it's extremely rare.  Since lineage is valued, male offspring of royal blood are highly sought after, resulting in a concentrated royal bloodline in the Meer Kingdom. The Queen's bloodline is the purest.  If, by chance, a royal produces a son, that boy will receive the Queen's affection.

The Meer Kingdom has been resolving genetic problems associated with this concentrated bloodline through foreign technologies. Japanese technology is considered the safest, so Her Majesty constantly desires it… as payment for rare metals.

"A commoner talking back to me, a royal!"

Although she knows she's not in the Meer Kingdom, in Leila's worldview, this commoner is equivalent to a slave. A slave talking back to royalty is unthinkable in the Meer Kingdom.

"Yes. This is Japan. Whether you're royalty or not, Leila-san, you're still a student."

"Th-this…"

Because she thought Moe was a noble, she hadn't been mindful of the "-san" honorific.  But now, knowing Moe is a commoner, she resents even this.

"Move!"

"Do you think I'd obey? I'm here to stop you from passing."

"Why are you stopping me in the first place?!"

"…Consider your own actions. Do you think knowing what you've done would make Yuuta-sama want to be close to you?"

"What?! That's none of your business!"

"It's not a matter of direct involvement. Your actions are unforgivable as a woman."

(Besides, Yukishiro-sama has become Yuuta-sama's lover.)

Yukishiro becoming Yuuta's lover hasn't been publicly announced yet.  It likely will be once Yukishiro resolves the issues within Minato.

"You can't pass. Please wait here until Lila-sama returns."


While Moe was stopping Leila at the entrance, Lila reached the room where Yuuta slept. Aoi and Manami were there.

"Lila-sama," Aoi calmly addressed her.

"Lila-sama is a specialist in memory science, correct?"

"Yes, that's right."

"Even if you take Yuuta-sama to the Meer Kingdom and examine his memories, there's no guarantee you'll find the reason he won't wake, right?"

"That's correct. I can only view the memory region.  I can't guarantee finding the reason for his unconsciousness."

"Understood. Thank you."

"However… from what I've heard, it seems some kind of memory is likely the cause."

“…”

Lila entered the room where Yuuta slept.  For a moment, Aoi and Manami saw Yuuta sleeping inside.

"If even meeting Suzune-san doesn't wake Yuuta-sama, or if we still don't know the reason…"

"Aoi-sama…"

"If Her Majesty grants permission for our accompaniment and observation during the examination, we could consider taking Yuuta-sama to the Meer Kingdom…"

Their accompaniment, observing the memory examination, and keeping Leila under surveillance in Japan to prevent her return to the Meer Kingdom—these conditions were necessary before they would consider taking Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom.  But if even meeting Suzune didn't wake him, there was nothing else they could do.  Without Lila examining his memory region, they could only wait for Yuuta to naturally wake up.

"…It's noisy at the entrance."

"Leila-san is probably yelling. Let's go help Moe-san."

"Yes."

Aoi and Manami headed toward the entrance. Leila's shouts were growing louder.  She seemed to be arguing with Moe.

"Leila-san."

"Ugh! You too!"

"It's late at night. Please don't shout so loudly."

"You guys! It's because you won't let me pass!"

"Leila-san is merely Lila-sama's attendant. You have no right to enter Yuuta-sama's room."

"I don't have a right, but you do?!"

"We don't either. Last night, we were only permitted to enter to assist Lilith-san with her examination."

Leila's irritation intensified with Aoi's infuriating appearance.

"If Yuuta-sama doesn't wake up, you'll take him to the Meer Kingdom, right?! Do you think you can treat me, a Meer Kingdom royal, like this?!"

"There's no right or wrong.  Yuuta-sama's matter is none of your concern. If we take Yuuta-sama to the Meer Kingdom, we'll obtain Her Majesty's formal permission."

"Ugh… I… I won't forgive you…"

No matter what Leila said, Aoi was correct. But Leila, whose mind was unraveling, couldn't process their words.  Her belief that she and Yuuta should be together fueled her hatred and her actions.

(I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you!  I won't forgive you! Yuuta-sama and I should be together!  These people… these people are interfering!)

Later, Leila, along with Lila, departed, casting hateful glares at Aoi and the others.
