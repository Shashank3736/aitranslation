Idle Talk ③: Hiroto

It's a hassle. That's what I thought during volunteer work.

The women I interact with are always smiling, but I couldn't care less about them.


I'm dating a girl who was directly under me in high school.

I plan to get engaged to her on her 20th birthday.

I also intend to make several of the girls who were subordinate to her, and obedient to me, my lovers.


It's not that I hate women.

I enjoy sex; it feels good.

But having sex with women I barely know… it's tiring and bothersome.


When I go to volunteer work, they all come begging for my body, dangling A-ratings and money.

I don't want to have sex with you.

At first… when I first had sex with a girl in exchange for volunteer work, I was excited.

It was fun.

During middle school, I was considered quite good at volunteer work because I was eager for sex.


In high school, when I formed my class, interactions with the girls who were directly and indirectly under me began.

The girl directly under me had a nice body, and I made my move fairly quickly.

If I made her my lover, she wouldn't complain.

Among the subordinate girls, I slept with those who obeyed my commands.

I don't dislike obedient women.


Once I could sleep with the girls directly and indirectly under me, volunteer work became increasingly bothersome.

Even when offered exchanges, like in middle school, I didn't want to sleep with the women in front of me.  I'd already slept with the girl directly under me the previous night, I wasn't in the mood for sex, and I could use the money from those girls anyway. There was no reason to accept volunteer work exchanges anymore.


By my third year of high school, I truly hated volunteer work.

I'd manage a smile, but I didn't actively participate, and if someone offered an exchange, I'd make a disgusted face and leave immediately.

The exchanges themselves are illegal, after all.

It's not like I could say that someone offended me by offering an illegal exchange.


And yet, there was this stupid girl among the subordinates who dared to say I should be more attentive to the women during volunteer work.

I immediately dismissed her and removed her subordinate status.


When I graduated high school, my male ranking remained D-rank.

I yelled at the female officer, "Why can't I be C-rank?!" but my rank didn't change.

That officer said I should focus more on society, not just the girls directly and indirectly under me.

What a fool.

I properly did my volunteer work!

I smiled at the women I met for the first time!

Those women who touched me and wanted to have sex are just stupid!



After graduating high school, I continued my relationship with my girlfriend (who was directly under me), occasionally doing volunteer work.

My girlfriend doesn't pressure me to do volunteer work.

She seems to understand me, but I don't know what will happen after we get married.

Because of that anxiety, I didn't immediately get engaged and occasionally met other girls.

My girlfriend's jealousy when I meet other girls is amusing.

She'd ask what she did wrong and beg me to forgive her.

She's really cute in that way.

It feels good.


Meeting other girls showed me it was still a hassle.

Every girl initially pretends to be obedient, expecting to be chosen, but once the conversation progresses, they start talking about volunteer work, society, etc…

I hated listening to them, so I started leaving as soon as they started that kind of talk.


My current girlfriend is the best fit for me, so I decided to get engaged to her.

When I told her I'd propose on her 20th birthday, she cried and rejoiced.

I'll probably get married on my birthday next year.



A few months before my 21st birthday, someone visited me.

It seemed like a high-ranking government official was with them, an unusual visit with bodyguards.


It was the head of the Minato Eigyo family.

One of the five great families of Japan.

I wondered what they wanted, but… it was an unbelievable offer.


They wanted to buy me.

Are they kidding?!

Why should I have a romantic relationship with and marry their daughter, someone I don't even know?!

They wanted me to go along with it…

Why would I have to do something so bothersome?!


Of course, I refused.

I don't care if it's the Eigyo family or not.

Yet, my fiancée told me to at least listen to their proposal.

What?

You heard their offer?

There's no point in listening to anything further, is there?


And the Minato head kept talking even after I refused.

Is he seriously crazy?

Thinking that, I listened to their proposal… and the terms from Minato were actually not bad.


It’s one of the five great families of Japan.

Considering their wealth and power, I understand my fiancée's perspective.

Her family is quite ordinary for a noble family.

Living the luxurious life of the Minato would be a dream come true for her.


At the end of the explanation, the Minato head asked, "What do you think?"

I had already refused, hadn't I?

I guess it means to reconsider after hearing all the conditions.


It wasn't… bad.

The conditions included raising my male ranking to C-rank.

But it wasn't enough, I thought.


"I have a condition to add."
"Please, state your request."
"Even if I marry your Saori, I want a separate house, not in the Minato mansion. Somewhere in a Minato-owned summer resort, where I can relax."
"As you wish."
"My fiancée and lovers will be living there too.  Take care of their daily lives as well."
"Understood."
"For the romantic marriage negotiations with Saori, I'll just smile silently. You handle the actual negotiations."
"Certainly."
"And... don't bother me. I'll marry Saori, but I don't intend to interact with her as a couple."
"... I will inform Saori."


I think I made several other minor requests.

The Minato head accepted everything I said.

My wishes were nothing to the head of the Minato Eigyo family.

So… I said this, though I thought it impossible.


"Make it so I don't have to do volunteer work."
"...Understood. Please allow us some time.  But we will surely meet Hiroto-sama's wishes."


Whoa, seriously?

Is that possible?

How powerful is the Eigyo family?!


"Is there anything else? Please, feel free to ask."
"Ah… no, nothing else."
"Then, we accept your conditions?"


If I accept, I'll be bought by Minato.

With Minato's power, all the problems I find bothersome will be solved.

My fiancée will have to wait, but she probably won't go against the power of Minato either.


"Alright. I accept."
"Thank you."


Thus, I was bought by Minato.

My marriage to my fiancée was postponed.




Saori, whom I met for the first time, was, as expected of the next head of the Minato Eigyo family, more beautiful than any woman I had ever seen.

Her physique… even though she's five years younger than my fiancée, she's much more attractive.

I thought I could sleep with her.




The wedding ceremony with the next head of the Minato Eigyo family was the most troublesome event ever.

On the wedding day, I just smiled silently.

Yet, one after another, women came to greet us, chattering endlessly.

Even the conversations Saori had with them were incredibly bothersome.

Saori always had a woman named Ena by her side, who handled all the troublesome matters.

So this is the world built by the Eigyo family… depressing.


After the ceremony, I was to stay at the Minato mansion that night.

Because of the first night.

I intended to sleep with Saori.

However, I was so exhausted from the wedding that I fell asleep without going to Saori's room.

When becoming lovers, it’s acceptable for the woman to visit the man at night, but for the first night, it's customary for the man to go to the woman's room.

The woman is not allowed to make the first move.


I slept without going to Saori's room, and the next day, as planned, I returned to the Minato summer resort mansion.

I live there with my fiancée and lovers.

Saori's eyes clearly showed she was sleep-deprived.

She had waited for me all night for the first night.

Well, I was tired, so it can't be helped.

I'll sleep with her when we have to have a child, I thought, and returned to the summer resort mansion.

Thus ended my wedding and first night, and I created the surname "Mochizuki" and gave it to Saori.



When I returned, my fiancée cried and hugged me.

She had been jealous, thinking I'd already slept with Saori.

Thinking she was cute, I told her I hadn't slept with Saori.

I actually just fell asleep from exhaustion, but to make her happy, I told her I didn't go to Saori's room for her sake.

My fiancée was overjoyed.


Then, a heavenly life began.

Without participating in Minato's tedious events or doing volunteer work, I enjoyed my days with my fiancée and lovers.

I received letters from Saori wanting to meet, but I refused them all to keep my fiancée happy.

Eventually, I stopped replying to her letters.

It was a hassle.

And it’s more fun for me when my fiancée and lovers are in a good mood.

I'll sleep with Saori eventually.

I want to sleep with her attractive body, but I don't want to live with her.

Staying at the Minato mansion is nothing but a hassle.

It's natural that I would prioritize my fiancée and lovers over Saori for pleasing me.



One day, a servant brought a letter.

Why would they deliver it directly to me?

I was told to read the letter, so I reluctantly read Saori's letter after a long time.

It contained her wish to have a child.

What?

Saori is only 18.

I thought we would wait until Saori turned 20…

Well, it's not my decision.

It's none of my business.

Since she wants it, I just have to sleep with Saori.


I told my fiancée that I had to go to the Minato mansion.

I couldn't leave without saying anything.


Then, my fiancée asked for the reason.

Well, there was no need to hide it, so I showed her the letter.

I could see her face twist in anger and hatred.

I heard that Minato had done something to her family.

Was it unforgivable?

I didn't ask the details; it's a hassle.


"Hiroto-sama"
"Hm?"
"Don't you want to hold a weakness over Minato?"


That sounded interesting.

Hold a weakness over Minato?

Is that even possible?


According to her, it wasn't about holding a weakness, but creating one.

I would refuse to have a child with Saori directly and only provide my sperm for artificial insemination.

As the wife who would bear a child, the conditions for the continuation of the Eigyo family's name are met.

However, it would be a weakness that no one should know about.


"Interesting."


I did want to sleep with Saori once.

But it wasn't a strong desire.

There are other women here if I just want to sleep with someone.

Creating a weakness for Minato, which will absolutely protect our lives, is more important than sleeping with Saori.

I accepted my fiancée's suggestion and wrote a reply to Saori.






Saori had a child using my sperm through artificial insemination.

It was funny that she sent me a letter of gratitude.

She doesn't really feel that way, does she?

She hates me, doesn't she?

But she can't do anything about it.

I'm Saori's husband, and she bore my child.

Along with a secret that should never be known.

The letter said she would increase the monthly allowance as a thank you.

It's hush money, huh?

I'll gladly accept it.





Saori had another child using the sperm I stored.

I found out from her letter.

She increased our weakness twofold.

She also wrote that she would increase the monthly allowance in gratitude.

Hush money for the second child.


I didn't visit either child after birth.

If I go to Minato, my wife and lovers would complain.

I'll probably never meet Saori's children.


Besides, my wife is pregnant now.

I plan to have children with my lovers as well.

I don't have time nor the desire to deal with Saori.

Her letter said she wanted me to visit the children, but I replied that I was busy.

For a while, Saori sent letters about the children's growth, but they stopped eventually.


My wife and lovers' children are raised in their respective families.

When my wife first had a child, I tried living with the baby.

Babies were cute to look at, but they cry loudly and are noisy.

Eventually, the children were raised in their families and sometimes visited us.

That's just right.






Once a year, I always receive a letter from Saori.

It's an invitation to the Holy Night Festival.

I received one this year too.




[Your letter, deeply grateful for the season; hope all's well.  Please forgive this audacious letter which may trouble you. The Holy Night Festival draws near. I understand this breaks our agreement. But, please, even once, could you join me at the festival? As your wife who bore your children, I dream of attending this festival; grant this foolish desire some mercy.  Even once, I want to show my daughters that we are husband and wife. My daughters will not be at the festival. I want to show them a picture of us together at the festival. A car will be waiting at the gate.  I long for the day we can attend the Holy Night Festival together. Sincerely, Saori Mochizuki]



She keeps sending letters every year, without getting tired of it.

Compared to the early days, the letters have become much shorter.

Unfortunately, I won't be attending the Holy Night Festival.

I have a party planned here every year.

My wife and lovers' children will also participate.

I can't miss it.





One day, an incident occurred.

A man named Takuya suddenly came to the mansion.

Takuya is apparently the boy Yukishiro, Saori's eldest daughter, is directly under.


I could have sent him away, but thinking I could curry favor with Minato, I let him in.

It turned out he came to find out how I live.

From his perspective, if he marries Yukishiro, he would become the husband of the next head of the Minato Eigyo family.

He must have been curious about how I, the husband of Saori, the current head, live.


My story is of no help, though.

He knew I was bought by Minato and started asking his questions.

When I told him that we didn't love each other, he began talking about the pretense of our romantic marriage.

He'll never know the true meaning of the phrase, "we didn't love each other."


Because of the sudden arrival of Takuya, the mansion's security has been strengthened.

Minato, of course, pays for the security costs.

Saori sent an apology letter, promising to prevent such events from happening again.





The Holy Night Festival letter arrived again this year.

Of course, I ignored it.





The Holy Night Festival letter arrived again this year.

However, the content felt slightly different.

It read like a farewell.

Maybe next year I won’t receive a letter.

If so, it doesn't bother me.

She finally gave up.





One of my lovers heard a rumor in Tokyo.

A rumor that Yukishiro is getting married.

Moreover, it's to the man marrying Aoi, the next head of the Yoshiwara Eigyo family?

The weddings will be held simultaneously?

That rumor is surely wrong.


If Yukishiro were getting married, I should get a letter from Saori.

Or… will I?

I haven't received any letters about Yukishiro and Iori for many years.

I didn't really care, but…

Surely, there should be at least a report if they were getting married?

By the way, what about Takuya, who suddenly came here two years ago?

You can't just change direct subordinates.

The rumor about Yukishiro getting married is definitely wrong.




A few months after hearing this rumor, a woman claiming to be a government envoy suddenly arrived at the mansion.
