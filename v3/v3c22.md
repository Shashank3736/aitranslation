Episode 22: The Crying Princess ②

The day after Yukishiro returned to Minato.

The heads of Minato's prominent families were gathered at the Minato mansion.

One after another, the heads of these historically significant families, who had supported Minato for generations, entered the room.


The hastily arranged meeting was to announce that Yukishiro, the next head of the Minato eternal family, was scheduled to marry Yuuta, with Aoi, the next head of the Yoshiwara eternal family, as his first wife, and Yukishiro as his second wife.

The phrasing "scheduled" was used because Yuuta ultimately held the final decision-making power.

Regardless of whether they were lovers or engaged, if a man ultimately decided not to marry, the marriage wouldn't happen.

Therefore, the announcement was only of a tentative plan.


Nearly twenty heads of prominent families had gathered in the large room prepared for the meeting.

The assembled heads of the families chatted amicably, with members of the same factions sitting together.

Among them was Kayane.

Kayane, who succeeded Ena, was only 24 years old, exceptionally young.

As the head of a family that had always supported the Minato head, even her youth didn't diminish her strong voice.  She ran numerous businesses, and her faction was the largest in the group.

She had been unable to frequently visit the Minato mansion for several years due to childcare, but she supported Saori, the woman her mother had served with her life, just as her mother had.

She had received reports from her younger sister, Ririka, about Yukishiro's unfortunate circumstances last year, but as the core issue involved her relationship with a directly affiliated male, it wasn't a matter Kayane could interfere with.


Other factions weren't all as fully supportive of Saori as Kayane was.

The cooperative relationship with Minato was based on mutual benefit; if that were to collapse, some families would distance themselves from Minato even further.


Saori and Yukishiro entered the room, exchanged brief greetings, and the meeting began.

Saori first explained that Yoshiwara's new venture, centered around Angel Suits, would be undertaken jointly with Minato.

Rumors about this had probably already spread.

Finalizing the details at a practical level would require discussions with many stakeholders.  Complete secrecy was impossible.


Angel Suits had achieved explosive popularity and a high level of prestige and desirability in Tokyo.

While some resistance to a joint venture with their longtime rivals, Yoshiwara, was inevitable, Yoshiwara didn't inherently need to collaborate with Minato.  This arrangement secured significant benefits for Minato.

The prospect of Minato entering this business was advantageous to all the families.


The momentum of Angel Suits in Tokyo was tremendous.  There were reportedly significant differences between high school classes that used Angel Suits and those that didn't.

The positive effects of using Angel Suits were particularly dramatic in classes that had problems with the relationships between directly affiliated males and females.


Furthermore, the suits positively impacted relationships with husbands or lovers.

Among adult men, Takashi of Yoshiwara was arguably the most adept at using Angel Suits.

Takashi actively recommended Angel Suits to men who had Yoshiwara-affiliated women as wives or lovers.

Pleasing both wives and lovers simultaneously was a source of joy and excitement for men.

The suits even facilitated the creation of games played only by wives and lovers, further enhancing their enjoyment.  This positive cycle encouraged men to actively use Angel Suits.

There was no reason to oppose a joint venture with Yoshiwara on Angel Suits, both for the benefits and for personal use.


The second announcement was that Yukishiro would become Yuuta's second wife in conjunction with the joint venture.

Because Aoi, Yoshiwara's next head, would be the first wife, Minato would appear subordinate to Yoshiwara.

Many people didn't take kindly to this; they disliked the prospect of being seen as inferior to Yoshiwara.


Yukishiro followed Saori, explaining that they planned to have a wedding ceremony with Aoi of Yoshiwara on Yuuta's birthday next year.

This too was tentative, dependent on Yuuta's feelings, but a joint wedding with Yoshiwara would signal that the second wife was equally valued as the first.


Yukishiro concluded by stating that they would maintain a positive rivalry with Yoshiwara while simultaneously forging a new partnership to work towards the prosperity of Tokyo.

Kayane immediately expressed her support.  With Kayane's support, other families within her faction quickly followed suit.


The bitter pill of being a second wife was sweetened by the Angel Suits, leaving other families with little choice but to agree.  Opposing the plan might exclude them from the lucrative Angel Suits business.  A joint wedding would at least save face.


With Kayane's active support, the discussion progressed smoothly.  Yukishiro, holding the fan with Manami's and her own Veronica design that Yuuta had given her, felt the tension ease as the atmosphere improved.

She had gained the understanding of the heads of the families who supported Minato regarding her marriage to Yuuta as his second wife.

She could now live as Yuuta's second wife and the next head of the Minato eternal family.


Just as the meeting was about to conclude, Saori dropped a bombshell.


"Once Yukishiro-san is successfully married to Yuuta-sama, I will relinquish the position of head of Minato to her."


This announcement stunned everyone, including Kayane.  Yukishiro, seated next to Saori, was also taken aback, though she had heard about it yesterday. She hadn't expected Saori to mention it at the meeting. She’d planned to discuss it with her mother later.


This statement drew significant opposition, even from Kayane.  Yukishiro, recently married, would be busy with childcare after having Yuuta's child.  Kayane, who knew better than anyone the hardships of being the head of the family, understood this would be even more challenging.


Saori, however, remained firm, stating she wouldn't retire but would help Yukishiro with childcare until things settled down. Even reasonable suggestions that the transfer of headship could wait until after she was settled were dismissed.


"By transferring the headship to Yukishiro-san sooner than Yoshiwara, we'll gain a stronger position in the next generation."


Some showed understanding of this point. They would be conducting joint business with Yoshiwara.  If Yukishiro had a head start as head of the family, she might gain leverage over Aoi of Yoshiwara. While the length of time as head of the family didn't determine their relationship, experience was significant.


However, Kayane opposed the idea, arguing it would make little practical difference in gaining control over Yoshiwara.  A change of leadership so soon after the wedding was too hasty.  She suggested waiting until Yukishiro had a child and that child entered kindergarten.  She used her own experience to persuade Saori.


"I understand your point, Kayane-san. We will continue to consider this further, but for now, please understand that Yukishiro-san will become the head once she marries Yuuta-sama."




The meeting ended, and Yukishiro had the opportunity to speak with Kayane, who she invited to her room to talk with Ririka.

The conversation focused on Yukishiro's recent life and detailed her smooth relationship with Yuuta.


She couldn’t reveal that Yuuta had collapsed and remained unconscious.  Ririka knew, but Kayane didn’t.  Akari and the others hadn’t told their mother either.  Ririka, however, had been informed by Akari because she needed to know the situation.


The conversation turned to why Saori wanted to relinquish the headship so quickly. Yukishiro explained that Saori had first mentioned it yesterday, and that she’d been completely surprised by the announcement at the meeting.


"Saori-sama is only 36 years old. Saying she's tired is absurd."


She seemed to be in the prime of her physical and mental strength.


"I'll investigate if something's wrong with Saori-sama. Please contact me if you find anything out, Yukishiro-sama."
"Yes. Kayane-san, thank you so much for today's meeting."
"That's all I can do. Yukishiro-sama, I'm sure you'll build a wonderful relationship with Yoshiwara. I will do what little I can to support you."


Kayane hugged Yukishiro tightly and gently stroked her hair.  Her gaze then shifted to Ririka, who was watching them.


"You must support Yukishiro-sama well."
"Yes! Leave it to me!"
"Don't let Yukishiro-sama get too involved in Ririka's otaku hobbies."
"Yes! I refuse!"
"That doesn't make sense!"


Yukishiro couldn't help but laugh, embraced by Kayane.


"I'm afraid I must leave now."


Kayane left the Minato mansion.  Nanase would come to pick up Yukishiro in the evening.  Having been accepted as Yuuta's second wife, she no longer needed Yoshiwara's protection.  However, she intended to return to Yuuta's side with Nanase.

While waiting for Nanase in her room, she enjoyed the milk tea Ririka had made.  As she chatted with Ririka, a knock came at the door.


"Yes?"
"Sister... It's Iori."


A listless voice called from outside.  She’d heard that Iori had been increasingly withdrawn to her own room, having grown to dislike the head family training.


"Please come in."


Yukishiro welcomed Iori with a gentle voice.


"Long time no see. How have you been?"
"…"


Her expression revealed that she wasn't doing well.  Iori bowed her head to Yukishiro and said in a trembling voice:


"Sister! I'm so sorry! I was foolish. I never considered how difficult it was to be the head of Minato, nor did I bear the burden of supporting you. I've been complaining."
"Was the head family training difficult?"
"Yes. I couldn't handle it. And… building trust with the other girls…"


Iori had been spoiled, and Saori and Yukishiro were to blame.  Yukishiro hadn't demanded anything of Iori because she knew she would become the head of the family. The same was probably true for Saori.  They had let Iori's mistakes go uncorrected.


"Iori-san, living is difficult. I struggle every day. Let's both work hard from now on."
"Yes. Will you forgive me?"
"Of course. You're my only dear little sister. We simply lacked understanding. It's not just your fault. I bear some responsibility too. So, let's grow together as sisters from now on."


Yukishiro smiled and looked at Ririka.


"Like Ririka-san and Kayane-san."
"Y-yes!"


Tears of joy streamed down Iori's cheeks.  Ririka offered her a handkerchief, which Iori accepted, apologizing to Ririka as well.


"Sister, you're not going back to Yoshiwara, are you?"


Iori seemed to know about the meeting.


"I need to go back today."
"Is that so?  You can tidy up your belongings later."
"There's a reason… but I'll be back soon, so don't worry. By the way, Iori-san, how has Mother been lately?  Has anything unusual happened?"


Yukishiro had been away from the Minato mansion for nearly eight months.  She wondered if Iori knew anything about a change in her mother's behavior.


"Mother's condition? Well… she returned around the end of July after being away since July and has been extremely busy, rushing around.  It’s probably… because of you, sister."
"I see…"


The informal meeting between Saori and Yukishiro took place on July 20th during Yuuta's class trip.  On that day, Yukishiro had told Saori about her relationship with Yuuta.  It had been a declaration of her unwavering feelings.


Having learned of her daughter's determination, Saori must have rushed around to coordinate things with the relevant parties after returning to the Minato mansion.  She had arranged the meeting with the heads of the supporting families within a month, gaining their acceptance of Yukishiro as Yuuta's second wife.


(She managed to resolve Minato's internal issues in such a short time.  She's understandably angry about my rash actions, but is she secretly happy as a mother?  But… something feels off.)


"Iori-san, how are things with Katsuya-sama?"
"With Katsuya-sama… it's not as smooth as it was in middle school. That's because I had such a narrow perspective back in middle school.  In high school, my relationships with the subordinate girls in class have been difficult…"
"It must be challenging. Are you using Angel Suits?"
"No, my class isn't. I've heard about Angel Suits.  The second and third-year classes seem to be using them actively."


Iori was also considering trying Angel Suits in the second year.


"Sister, you seem worried about Mother's condition."
"Yes… something seems off about her."
"It's probably just you she's worried about."
"Just me?"
"Yes. Mother… never expected anything from me. Because she knew I wasn't cut out to be the head of the family, she didn't expect much from me and spoiled me.  But it's different with you. She had high hopes for you as the next head of the Minato eternal family."
"I failed to meet her expectations…"


Her early relationship with Takuya had ended with their affiliation being dissolved.


"I think that's irrelevant."
"Really?"
"Yes. Mother said Takuya was foolish about that incident. I rarely heard her criticize your actions."


Yukishiro had been told not to cause Takuya to act out, but she didn't think her actions had been strongly criticized.  The dissolution of their affiliation had been arranged to not cast blame on her.  However, she hadn't been able to accept being forced to marry a stranger.


"Maybe she doesn't really want me to be Yuuta-sama's second wife…"
"…"


Both Iori and Ririka remained silent.  No one could understand Saori's true feelings.  It was a matter of Saori's heart.


(Ena-san told me that Grandmother destroyed Mother's heart.  She fabricated a nonexistent romance between Mother and Father…)


Yukishiro's grandmother, out of rivalry with Nanase of Yoshiwara, had strictly ordered Saori to get married for love.  Following this order, Saori had desperately frequented a certain boy's classroom in middle school.  In the end, the boy ran away from her.


(What kind of relationship did Mother and Father really have?  Even if it wasn't like Nanase-sama and Takashi-sama, I thought they were a decent couple... our parents…)


Neither Yukishiro nor Iori had any memories of meeting their father.  He was a figment of their imagination.  His existence was confirmed last summer…


(Takuya-sama met Father.  He seemed to have gone to see how he was living as the husband of the Minato head…)


"Yukishiro-sama,"


A voice called from outside, accompanied by a knock.  It was too early for Nanase to arrive.


"Yes?"
"The head of the family is calling for you."
"I understand."


It was a summons from Saori.
