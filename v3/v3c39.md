Episode 39: New Year's Eve ②

After finishing his meeting with the Prime Minister, Yuta headed towards the villa built for him on Minato's estate.

Completed in December, this villa would also serve as a place for Yuta to interact with Yukishiro, who had returned to Minato.

Next to the villa, another building connected by a walkway had been constructed.

It was a building for Aoi and the others.

At Yuta's villa in Yoshiwara, while Yukishiro was under protection, a connected building was constructed, where Yukishiro lived.

Similarly, at Yuta's villa in Minato, another building was built so that not only Yuta, but also Aoi and the others could come to play anytime.

This year's New Year's Eve would be spent with everyone at Minato's villa.


"Welcome home."

"I'm home."


Upon returning to Minato's villa, Yukishiro greeted him.

Akari was with her.

And then...


"Welcome home, Master ♡"


Behind Yukishiro and Akari, Aoi, Manami, and Moe, dressed in neat and cute maid outfits, greeted Yuta with smiles.


"You're really getting into it," Yuta commented.

"Hehehe, since we had the chance," Aoi replied.


It wasn't just Aoi and the others who were dressed in maid outfits.

Another woman, standing next to them, also wore a maid outfit and greeted Yuta.


"Ririka, that looks good on you," Yuta said.

"Thank you ♪"


Ririka was also enthusiastically dressed in her maid outfit.


"Ririka's maid outfit is so cute ♪"

"It's because Aoi-sama and the others have such good style～♪"


Aoi and the others had become good friends with Ririka.

While Yukishiro was under Yoshiwara's protection, Ririka had visited the Yoshiwara villa many times, where she befriended Aoi, the others, and Yuta.

And now, at Minato's villa, their friendship deepened further.

The maid outfits Aoi and the others were wearing were handmade by Ririka, reflecting her personal taste.


They all returned to the room, and Yuta explained the details of his meeting with the Prime Minister.

He relayed how he conveyed his feelings.

He mentioned the proposal to create a special district within the "Small World".

And that the Prime Minister and Nanase would discuss designating a region including Makuhari (where Inma Land is located) as this special district.


"That's basically it. It seems I'll be involved in managing the Small World as well," Yuta explained.

"Yuta-sama...this is incredible.  It's already unusual to disclose Small World information to men, but to even manage it..."


Being involved in managing the Small World meant he could establish rules within that special district.

Of course, not all rules would be accepted, but experimental measures could be implemented.


"Naoto will start elementary school in April of the year after next, so we have one year and four months. Within that time, we'll aim to create the Small World's special district, including Makuhari," Yuta said.

"Mother will cooperate in creating the special district for Naoto-kun and Sakurako-san. It would also benefit Father. Makuhari is also close to Tokyo."

"Minato should also be able to cooperate with the Small World's special district under Yuta-sama's management. Minato owns land in Makuhari."

"Thank you.  I don't know what will happen yet, but when Naoto-kun and Sakurako-san consider this proposal favorably, I'll ask for your cooperation."


The special district proposed by the Prime Minister was overwhelmingly larger than other Small Worlds.

Considering it as a special district where five boys could live in an environment where they could see their mother whenever they wanted, it could be seen as creating another male-only area.

The boys' reactions and growth would be observed and evaluated, and if this Small World thrived, it might even be officially recognized as the fifth male-only area.

While it would still be a long way off, considering the Prime Minister's proposal, Yuta felt that future was possible.


"If Naoto-kun lives in the special district, he'll live separately from Sakurako-san, right?"

"Yes.  We're thinking of separating their rooms. It would be good if the mother were in the next room, and the child could see her whenever they want.  When he becomes a junior high student, we could separate the buildings themselves.  Maintaining physical distance while keeping emotional closeness.  And preventing excessive influence from the mother on the boy as he grows up, and vice versa.  That kind of relationship..."


What was the right answer?  Perhaps there wasn't even a right answer.

The boys raised in Yuta's envisioned special district might become better individuals for many women in the future.

However, it could also become the cause of other major problems.

They would have to strive for improvement through trial and error.


After discussing the Small World, they enjoyed chatting, preparing and eating a hot pot dinner together.

Yuta, who had spent two weeks bedridden in August, resulting in decreased physical strength, had now fully recovered and was in good health.

Spending time like this, intimately with everyone, was truly happiness.


Last year's New Year's Eve, a heavy snowstorm raged.

Akari, after hearing from Ririka about Yukishiro's disappearance, contacted Aoi, mobilizing the organization for a search.

They successfully found Yukishiro in a park, and exactly one year had passed since she was taken under Yoshiwara's protection.

Remembering the New Year's Eve two years ago, that day could be considered the day the current Yuta was born.

Thanks to Liliths' soul fusion, Yuta awakened.

Something significant happened every New Year's Eve.

This year's New Year's Eve, he heard about managing the Small World after the meeting with the Prime Minister.

That could also be considered a major event.

And the major event of this year's New Year's Eve wasn't over yet.


After finishing the delicious hot pot, Yuta still had something to do.


"Then, I'll be going."

"Have a safe trip."

"Yukishiro-san, let's go."

"Yes."


Yuta went with Yukishiro to Minato's main residence.

To meet Saori.


Saori had met with the Prime Minister that evening.

After Yuta met with the Prime Minister, Saori also had a meeting with him.

Although the Prime Minister usually took New Year's Eve off, he arranged meetings with both Yuta and Saori.





Yuta had heard from Yukishiro about Saori, Hiroto, and Yukishiro's own origins.

The information was shocking.

Yuta learned the real reason Saori hadn't met him.

Saori's circumstances were incredibly sad and painful, and Yuta's heart ached for her.


Now, for the first time, Yuta would meet Saori.

Saori had told Yukishiro that she wanted to meet Yuta on New Year's Eve.

After Saori's meeting with the Prime Minister.


Yuta entered Minato's main residence for the first time.

He was greeted by Iori, Yukishiro's younger sister.


"Nice to meet you, Yuta-sama. It's an honor."

"Nice to meet you too, Iori-san."


Although it was New Year's Eve, the mansion wasn't entirely empty.

Only Iori greeted him, intentionally.


"I'll guide you."


Iori led him to Saori's room.

He had heard a lot about Iori from Yukishiro.

Apparently, after Yuta lost consciousness, the sisters reconciled and were rebuilding their relationship as close sisters.


"Mother. I've brought Yuta-sama and my sister."


Iori opened the door, revealing Saori in a kimono.

Upon making eye contact with Yuta, she immediately bowed.


"I've been waiting. I am Saori, Yukishiro's mother, and the head of the Minato Eternal Family.  Please accept my apologies for my past impoliteness. I am beyond grateful for you meeting with me."

"Please raise your head. I'm happy to meet you, Saori-san."


It was incredibly unreasonable for a mother to refuse a meeting with her daughter's boyfriend.

Despite the circumstances, her actions were impolite towards Yuta, and she apologized.


"I am grateful for your generous heart, Yuta-sama."


Saori's expression, after raising her head, was completely different from the impression Yuta had heard.

She was a beautiful woman with a soft, gentle smile.


"Please, come in."

"Yes."


Yuta and Yukishiro entered the room and sat down side-by-side.

Saori sat opposite Yuta, and Iori, after preparing tea, sat next to Saori, opposite Yukishiro.


Yuta was the first to speak.


"Once again, Saori-san, Iori-san, I'm so glad to meet you."

"I'm truly happy to meet you, Yuta-sama. As a mother, I believed I shouldn't meet Yuta-sama, my daughter's lover...I acted extremely impolitely towards you."

"It was due to the circumstances. I don't mind. I... through spending time with Yukishiro-san, I came to like her, wanting to know her better.  I confessed to her before getting your approval, and we became lovers. Regardless of how unique the situation was, I think I was disrespectful to you, Saori-san."

"No, it was..."


In this world, a man doesn't need to worry about a mother's opinion when confessing his love to a woman.

Despite that, Yuta apologized because he understood Saori's feelings.


"I want to tell you, Saori-san, again, properly. I love Yukishiro-san. I truly love her.  Since we became lovers, my feelings have only grown stronger. I want her to always smile by my side."

"Thank you...  As a mother, those are the most wonderful words I could hear. Please, be kind to Yukishiro-san and have a long and happy life together.  My daughter lacks nothing, as the head of the Minato Eternal Family."


Saori was already tearing up.

Even before meeting Yuta, she'd felt a tension she'd never experienced before.

When she met Yuta, he seemed even more mature than in his broadcasts.

Considering Saori's impoliteness towards Yuta and her treatment of Yukishiro, it would have been understandable for Yuta to resent her. Yet, he spoke to her with a smile and kind words.


"Today, in this meeting with you, Saori-san, and Iori-san, there's something I want to give Yukishiro-san."


Yuta took a box from his pocket.

A box containing an engagement ring.

Looking at Yukishiro, whose face was lit up with happiness, Yuta opened the box and presented her with the ring.


"Yukishiro-san, will you marry me? I want you by my side forever."

"Thank you. I'm truly happy to become Yuta-sama's fiancée."


He proposed to Yukishiro in front of Saori and Iori.

Although she had been told beforehand, receiving the proposal and the ring from Yuta brought tears of joy to Yukishiro's eyes.

Seeing this, Saori couldn't hold back her tears either.

Iori also seemed genuinely happy to witness Yuta and Yukishiro's happy smiles.


"I'll get engaged to Yukishiro-san."

"Yes... thank you. Thank you."


Saori repeatedly thanked Yuta.


"On my 18th birthday next year... I want to marry Yukishiro-san, together with Aoi-san of the Yoshiwara Eternal Family."

"Thank you... for taking my daughter...Yukishiro-san, as your wife. Thank you."

"As Yuta-sama's wife, I will support you for life."


Yuta and Yukishiro's engagement was finalized.

Getting engaged on Yukishiro's birthday in June next year would leave too little time for the wedding preparations.

Given that Saori's issues were also resolving, Yuta decided to propose on New Year's Eve, in front of Saori and Iori.





After their engagement, the four of them enjoyed a conversation.

To further understand each other and build a good future relationship, they discussed various things.

The conversation turned to Saori's future.


"I've received kind words from the Prime Minister. It won't cause any trouble for Yuta-sama."


Once married to Yuta, Yukishiro would become the head of the Minato Eternal Family.

At 18, she would be the youngest head of the family in history.

Saori had intended to leave the Minato main residence once Yukishiro became head, but now, things were different.


"Until Yuta-sama and Yukishiro-san's children grow up, I would like to assist with the head's duties here."


Saori didn't intend to leave the Minato main residence but would instead help Yukishiro with her duties.


"Mother can keep using this room," Yukishiro said happily.

Yukishiro wanted Saori to continue using the head's room even after she became head.


"But that's... As the head, Yukishiro, you need to make a clear statement."

"We can simply change the location of the head's room.  When I become head, the head's room will be in Yuta-sama's villa."

"What?!  Is that alright?"


Yuta was surprised by Yukishiro's words, when Iori interjected.


"Sister, that won't do. We should renovate the main residence and build a new head's room for you. Do you intend to conduct head duties from Yuta-sama's villa?"

"Oh, you're right.  Conducting head duties in Yuta-sama's villa... that would disrupt his rest."


Yukishiro seemed quite elated after receiving her mother and sister's blessings on her engagement and impending marriage to Yuta.


"If I'm going to use this room, we should build a new head's room for Yukishiro-san. Let's renovate before next year's wedding with Yuta-sama," Saori declared.


The renovation of Yukishiro's head's room was decided.

Then, the conversation turned to Saori herself... and her husband, Hiroto.


"I... after Yuta-sama marries Yukishiro-san, I will divorce my husband. Yukishiro-san, Iori-san, I'm sorry."

"Mother doesn't need to apologize!"

"That's right. Mother did nothing wrong!"


If Hiroto heard Iori saying he did nothing wrong, he would probably yell, accusing Minato of ruining his life and demanding money.

But those words wouldn't resonate with Yukishiro, Iori, or Yuta.


(Takuyan also said that... If he didn't like it, he shouldn't have been bought...)


The previous head, Saori's mother, had undoubtedly acted forcefully.

She might have pressured or manipulated Hiroto's fiancée and the women he was involved with.


Still, if he had truly disliked it.

If Hiroto, as a man, had firmly refused, Minato wouldn't have been able to make him Saori's husband.

Hiroto accepted Minato's offer.

He made that decision himself.


Yet, his subsequent actions towards Saori and Minato were unacceptable to his daughters, Yukishiro and Iori.

He was their father, but knowing the truth about him, they didn't feel like defending him.


"Divorces are usually initiated by men.  Officially, it will appear as if Hiroto-sama initiated the divorce."


After losing Minato's protection, how would Hiroto and the others live?

Hiroto would have to engage in service activities.

If his wives and lovers had their own income, they would support him.

However, as far as Saori's investigations revealed... that wasn't the case.

Hiroto's second wife and lovers lived luxuriously on the money Hiroto received from Minato.


"Hiroto-sama and the women will be placed under state supervision.  To prevent them from extorting or threatening Minato because of me... the state will monitor them.  The Prime Minister didn't explicitly state it... but they'll likely be sent to the Small World, along with the women."


Hiroto hadn't engaged in service activities since marrying Saori.

That meant he hadn't participated in sperm donation service, which starts at age 18.

He provided Saori with sperm, but nothing else.

His second wife and lovers had children through sexual intercourse with Hiroto, but from society's perspective, Hiroto was essentially nonexistent, like a man who didn't fulfill his most important role.


Even if all the facts were revealed, Minato would remain an Eternal Family.

But thinking of Yukishiro, Saori didn't want this secret to be known.

The Prime Minister told Saori not to worry about it.

Saori trusted the Prime Minister and left the matter to him.





"Yukishiro-san and Iori-san, I have a request.  Once my divorce from Hiroto-sama is finalized... let's visit Ena's grave together. I want to report to Ena in heaven."

"Yes."


While Ena was alive, Saori wasn't alone.

Amidst unbearable suffering and hardship, Ena, who knew everything, supported Saori.

What about Ena?

Ena, without telling her husband, carried her burden alone.

As Yukishiro said, Ena risked her life to protect the mother-daughter relationship between Saori, Yukishiro, and Iori.





After a while, a knock came on the door, and Ririka's voice was heard.


"I've come to pick you up."


Ririka had come to pick up Yuta.


"Then I'll take my leave.  Please get along as a family from now on."

"I'm grateful for the connection with Yuta-sama. I am an inadequate mother, but I promise to do my best for Yuta-sama."


In a warm atmosphere, Yuta left with Ririka, returning to the villa.

As they left the room, Ririka exchanged a meaningful glance with Yukishiro.


"Iori-san."

"Yes."

"I want to talk to Mother alone for a bit."

"Understood. I'll leave you two."


Following Yuta, Iori also left the room.

Only Yukishiro and Saori remained.


"Mother, thank you for meeting Yuta-sama and blessing us."

"I'm the one who should be thanking you.  For getting engaged in front of your pathetic mother... I bless you again. Yukishiro-san, congratulations. Support Yuta-sama and be happy."

"Yes. As Yuta-sama's wife and the head of the Minato Eternal Family, I will continue to strive."


Saori was overwhelmed with emotion.

She never thought she, who had believed herself cursed, could feel this much happiness as a mother.


"Mother... our... mother-daughter relationship... I hope we can deepen our love and bond even further."

"Me too. Thank you... I'm so happy."


Seeing Saori's happy smile, Yukishiro was happy too.

And the next moment, Yukishiro's expression changed to a mischievous, childlike smile.


"Mother."

"Yes?"

"I have a present for my beloved mother."

"A present?"

"Just a moment."


Yukishiro stood up and brought a large box that had been placed outside the door.

Ririka had placed it there when she came to pick up Yuta.


"Here you are."

"A large box. I wonder what's inside?"

"Please open it."


Saori opened the box Yukishiro gave her.  Inside...


"Ah! Th-this is..."

"Mother...this is..."

"What?!"


Yukishiro handed Saori a smaller, wooden box she had been holding.

It was the box containing the short sword Saori had given her as a charm.


"I'm returning it to you, Mother."

"Wh-why...?"

"Hehehe...Mother... as you probably know..."


Yukishiro hugged her beloved mother, whispering as they looked at the contents of the box together.


"In Japan... children are limited to a maximum of three. The third child... is only permitted if it is the result of sexual intercourse between a man and a woman."

"Yukishiro-san..."

"Mother... I wish to build a new loving mother-daughter relationship with you... Of course, it's not something that can be achieved by our feelings alone... But you're a very charming mother."

"Wh-what are you... what are you saying?!"

"I understand perfectly. I understand, and I desire a new relationship with you, Mother... Of course, with the help of a certain, charming person."

"Ah, Y-Yukishiro-san!?"


Yukishiro began to touch her mother's body in a slightly suggestive way.


"I hope you'll accept my offer... to offer this short sword... as a pledge of our relationship."

"Su-such a... such a thing..."

"Mother, first we should try playing "My Boyfriend's Love Memories".  You'll certainly have a wonderful experience of middle and high school life."

"Yes... I will try..."


Yukishiro's emotional appeal worked.

The emotional appeal learned from Aoi would prove useful here, of all places.


(Aoi-san, thank you.)


Yukishiro silently thanked Aoi.

And then...


(Mother... after "My Boyfriend's Love Memories," let's play "I Still Love You"... I'm sure Mother... with me...)





And so, this year's New Year's Eve ended, ushering in the New Year.
