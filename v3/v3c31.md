Episode 31: Second Semester

September 1st.

Yuta's second year of high school began its second semester with increased splendor.  Sixteen new girls had joined his class: the Minato group, consisting of Yukishiro (Yuta's direct subordinate) and fifteen other girls from prominent families who were under Yukishiro's command.

Combined with the original Yoshiwara group of 39 girls, the class now had 55 female students.  Although splitting the class into two was considered due to the sheer number, they decided to keep it as one class in a larger room to foster interaction between the Yoshiwara and Minato groups.

The sight of 55 girls in their somewhat sexy summer uniforms was a feast for the eyes.  Despite his initial anxieties, Yuta found himself energized by the class's vibrant atmosphere.

Although already officially registered, Yukishiro reaffirmed her direct subordination to Yuta, followed by the confirmation of the other 15 girls' subordination to Yukishiro.  The Yoshiwara group offered their blessings, uniting the class in joy.

The major events of the second semester were the October school trip and the November cultural festival. While school trips sometimes involved destinations outside Tokyo or even overseas, considering Yuta's health, they opted for a location near Tokyo.

The destination announcement, made by Yuta, elicited ecstatic cheers from the entire class:

"For our October school trip, we'll be visiting 'Inma Land,' the newly constructed theme park in Makuhari! We've secured a private booking before its official opening."

Inma Land, a theme park built by Yoshiwara, features sex toys themed around "淫魔" (Inma - a term suggesting succubi or similar figures) and initially intended as a dedicated park for Inma Yuu (Yuta).  It's now planned to include attractions for other men who have begun working as Inma, though most of the park still focuses on Inma Yuu.

"There are all sorts of interesting features, so let's all have fun together!"

Inma Land boasts memory-based features, most notably unique memory data available only there: Inma Yuu's voice recordings, physical contact and penetration simulations, and even secret scenarios for an Inma Yuu-exclusive VR game.

"For the school trip, we'll hide 'unique data' for each of you, so try to find it!"

The unique data is a one-of-a-kind data set; a personalized audio message for each of the 56 girls (including Tomoe).  These messages will be automatically downloaded to a tablet at specific locations within the park.

Even after the official opening, these unique data sets will remain hidden somewhere in Inma Land. Once downloaded, the data will be unavailable to others. Only the finder will possess it.  However, sharing it freely is permitted, so they'll likely spread gradually.  Selling them is strictly forbidden; violators will be permanently banned from Inma Land.  Everyone must bring a succubus costume to wear within the park.


Following the October school trip, the November cultural festival awaits.  It will be similar to last year's, but with double the invited guests due to including the Minato group alongside the Yoshiwara group.

They discussed possibly shortening the festival from a week to four days, and other details are to be finalized later.  Anticipating the various cosplay outfits, Yuta was already looking forward to it.

They concluded the first day of the second semester after discussing volunteer activities and class interactions.


Yuta, Aoi, Manami, Yukishiro, and Akari moved from the large classroom to a smaller one. There, Yukishiro presented Yuta with a short sword – not the one from Saori, but one she had prepared herself.

"Thank you," Yuta replied, happily accepting the gift.

While the short sword was significant, their gathering in this smaller classroom was for another matter:  future interactions between Yuta and Yukishiro.

Yukishiro returned to Minato in September after thanking Nanase and the others in Yoshiwara at the end of August. This meant Yuta would have to travel to Minato to meet Yukishiro.  However...

"Eh?  In Yoshiwara?"
"Yes.  For a while, I'd like to continue interacting with you, Yuta-sama, at the Yoshiwara mansion."
"That's fine, but..."

Yukishiro requested that their interactions take place at the Yoshiwara mansion.

"We're building a mansion for Yuta-sama in Minato, just like the one in Yoshiwara."
"Oh my♪"
"It's scheduled for completion in December."
"Thank you for doing that for me.  So, until that mansion is finished, it'll be in Yoshiwara?"

While he appreciated the new mansion, the arrangement seemed odd.  They could just meet at Minato's main residence. Was there a problem?

"There's something... unresolved between my mother and me."
"Is it possible Saori-san doesn't welcome me?"
"No! That's not it.  It's just..."

Even Yukishiro struggled to explain. But she couldn't remain silent about this mother-daughter issue, choosing to confide in Yuta, Aoi, and the others.

"I don't know what problem my mother is facing.  I don't understand what it is."
"You don't know what the problem is..."
"Mother is suffering from something.  I hoped she'd go see my father to solve this problem, but she wouldn't allow it."
"Yukishiro-san's father?"
"Yes.  I think the problem my mother's facing is related to my father.  But even so... why..."

Why wouldn't Saori meet Yuta? Saori had said it was alright to bring Yuta to the Minato main residence, yet she intended to leave the mansion at that time.

Saori insisted she didn't dislike Yuta.  So, even if Yukishiro pleaded for a meeting, Saori would refuse.  At this rate, Saori might even miss Yuta's wedding ceremony.

"If we meet Yukishiro-san's father, would we understand the cause of Saori-sama's troubles?"
"Whether we would or not... In any case, I didn't get permission from my mother."

Yukishiro responded with a listless tone. Hearing this, Aoi exclaimed...

"We could just go see him!"
"...It's impossible.  Last year... Takuya-sama..."

Last summer, Takuya had made a surprise visit.  While they managed to handle it at the time, security tightened afterwards, making surprise visits impossible.


"I don't want Yuta-sama to misunderstand. My mother doesn't dislike you. She's just... struggling with a personal problem. Please give her some time."
"Understood.  Until then, let's continue our interactions at the Yoshiwara mansion as usual.  Akari-san can join us too."
"Yes. Thank you."

A few days into the second semester, Yuta met Ayaka in his private room in the men's-only area and heard unexpected news from Hanasaki, Takuya's handler.

"Leila-san, to me?"
"Yes. While Yuta-sama was unconscious, Leila-san, as the caretaker of Mila Kingdom's Princess Rira, tried to make contact with Yuta-sama, though Aoi-sama and the others haven't mentioned it to you."
"Ah, it was strange that Leila-san was there when I woke up.  I did hear later that she was the caretaker of Princess Rira, but... to make contact with me?"
"Yes. Leila-san's objective was clearly Yuta-sama.  We don't know what her purpose was, though."
"I see...  So, she might try to contact me again?"
"Hanasaki-san also said she didn't know if Leila-san would contact you again.  But she asked for you to contact her if she did."
"Well, contacting her is easy enough. Understood.  If Leila-san tries to contact me, I'll immediately contact Ayaka-san or Tomoe-san."
"I'll let her know we'll cooperate."
"Please. But even if she tries to contact me... It's practically impossible, right? We have no connection."
"Yes... The only possibility is the night gathering at the November cultural festival."
"Ah, true."
"However, Takuya-sama won't be attending the night gathering."
"Eh? Really?"
"Yes. Due to last year's incident, Takuya-sama's participation has been canceled."
"That means there's almost no chance for Leila-san to contact me..."
"None, really. Besides... Hanasaki-san said that the cooperation period won't be long."
"Not long?"
"We don't know.  It's better that we don't know."

Ayaka suspected Hanasaki's true affiliation was the Public Security.  She wasn't sure if Hanasaki was investigating Leila, but Leila's name implies a Mila Kingdom connection.

Yuta also pondered. The Prime Minister's request for cooperation was simply to contact Hanasaki if Leila contacted him.  He didn't know what would happen next, but it must benefit the Prime Minister somehow.  However, waiting for Leila to contact him was highly unlikely, given his protection from Yoshiwara, Minato, and their organizations.


(Leila-san is Takuya-kun's direct subordinate. Hanasaki-san is Takuya-kun's handler...)

"Ayaka-san."
"Yes."
"I want to meet and talk with Hanasaki-san."
"...Understood."

He decided to meet Hanasaki and make a proposal.  He was also curious about the Prime Minister's response, and gaining favor with the Prime Minister's side might positively influence future negotiations.

"To diligently work hard on one thing at a time..."

These were the words he said to Aoi on his birthday, when she asked about his future while they walked in the garden.

"That's wonderful."
"First... there's Suzune-san's retrial next week.  It's an important retrial for me, too."
"Yes."
"I'll talk about the crimes I committed."
"Yuta-sama..."

What Yuta did wouldn't be considered a crime in Japan.  Still, it was a matter of his own conscience.
