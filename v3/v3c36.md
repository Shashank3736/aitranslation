Episode 36: Gratitude and Apology

Late November.  The school's cultural festival was approaching.

Yuta's school started its festival three days earlier than usual.  This was because Yukishiro, Akari, and their group's participation had increased the number of invitees beyond those associated with Yoshiwara, including many from Minato, making the usual timeframe insufficient.

As in previous years, female students from the general populace were enlisted to help.  Yoshiwara and Minato students mixed together, creating a fun and naturally fostering interaction.  While the division between Yoshiwara and Minato groups didn't entirely disappear, their healthy competition spurred growth.  This also seemed to be bridging the gap between prominent families and ordinary citizens within Minato.

Yuta streamed the festival again this year.  He even reunited with Kyoka and Renka, whom he interviewed last year, further enhancing his enjoyment.  Attendees were overjoyed to receive Angel suits and participate in a final group hug with Yuta.

On the final day, after enjoying the festival, Yuta attended an evening party.  The class party was scheduled for the following day.

Aoi, Yukishiro, Manami, Akari, and Moe attended.  Aoi yielded her first dance with Yuta to Yukishiro, whom Yuta already had a relationship with and confessed to again at the party, dancing to a song only lovers could dance to.  He then danced with Aoi, and then Akari (after Manami graciously gave up her turn).  Yuta also confessed to Akari, who, although striving to become his girlfriend, was still surprised and overjoyed, crying tears of happiness.  Even Yukishiro couldn't hold back her tears at the scene.

Next, Yuta danced with Manami, and finally, Moe.  Moe, too, experienced unexpected happiness as Yuta confessed his feelings for her.  For a commoner like Moe to receive a confession at the cultural festival's evening party, a formal event, was a momentous and truly Cinderella-like occasion.

The following evening was the class party.  Fifty-five girls adorned in dazzling dresses attended, including their teacher, Tomoe, and Ayaka (who was also participating this year).  Keita's class also joined.  While it was just Keita and Hazuki last year, Keita's class was much larger now, with 14 girls under Hazuki's direct supervision.  Hazuki was in high demand, with many classes seeking advice on Keita's successful class management using Angel suits.  This was also a long-awaited reunion for Keita and Rin, his supervising official and teacher, as they hadn't seen each other since the August organizational exchange meeting. Keita, more confident and capable than ever thanks to his successful class management, had become a reliable figure, with high expectations from the country.

Although Yuta's headaches had stopped, considering his health and workload, the class party dances remained the same as last year: one song, multiple dancers.  The joyful time with everyone passed by in a flash.


December.  The second semester ended, and the year was drawing to a close.

Hanasaki visited Yuta after the successful cultural festival and party.  Ayaka and Tomoe were also present.

The country had achieved significant results thanks to Yuta's cooperation. While the specifics were undisclosed, Yuta didn't need to know.  What he wanted to discuss was his question:

"How can a boy maintain a connection with his mother?"

He'd presented this question to the Prime Minister.  Hanasaki’s response was unexpected:


“Let’s meet on New Year’s Eve.  To fulfill your wish, I want to discuss the ‘small world.’”


The Prime Minister seemed willing to disclose information about the "small world" to Yuta and engage in a positive discussion towards fulfilling his wish.  The details would be revealed later.

Aside from this, Hanasaki shared additional information—a thank you for Yuta taking on risky actions during their cooperation.


"What? I didn't do anything."
"Yes, you did nothing."
"That...means exactly what it sounds like?"
"Yes."
"But Yukishiro's father's male rank is C-rank?"
"Yes."
"So Minato... Saori was secretly dealing with the country?"
"Yes.  More precisely, Hiroto requested that Minato compensate him for not performing civic duty."
"Is that legal?"
"Legally, it's illegal. But Minato is obligated to compensate Hiroto for his lack of civic duty.  The transaction between Minato and the country is complete."
"I see...so he won't be prosecuted?"
"No, Minato won't be prosecuted. But there's no transaction between Hiroto and the country."
"What?"
"Hiroto's C-rank is because he submitted false civic duty reports to the country.  The application of those false reports is a result of the transaction with Minato.  If Minato's protection ends, he will be prosecuted."
"What does that mean? Minato's protection ends?  But Hiroto is Saori's husband?  His protection ending...?"


Divorce exists, but only men can initiate it.  Women cannot sever ties with their husbands, no matter what.


"If Saori ceases to be the head of Minato, Minato can stop compensating Hiroto for his lack of civic duty—unless Yukishiro continues it."
"To stop the compensation to the country?"
"How to do that is up to you and Yukishiro. What I can tell you is that without Minato's compensation, Hiroto will have to choose between performing actual civic duty or stopping the false reports.  If Hiroto continues the false reports without Minato's protection, it will become a crime."


Hiroto is 41 this year.  It's unlikely a man who's falsified civic duty reports for over 20 years will suddenly start performing them.  Without civic duty, his male rank will eventually drop.


"Even if Hiroto's rank drops, he's Saori's husband, so he won't be in financial need, right?"
"Whether Hiroto cares about his male rank is unknown. If he doesn't mind it dropping, and Saori is willing to support him, then he'll be fine."
"What do you mean?"
"Exactly what it sounds like. As head of the Minato family, having a husband is an absolute condition.  But if she's no longer the head, it's not. Even if she divorces Hiroto, Saori wouldn't be in trouble.  Hiroto would be the one facing problems."


Hanasaki's words implied Saori wanted a divorce.


(What's going on?  From what Yukishiro told me...Saori was waiting for Hiroto at the Holy Night Festival.  She didn't seem to want a divorce...)


Hanasaki continued:


"Do you know why Hiroto was chosen as Saori's husband, Yuta?"
"Uh...because of a boy from her middle school class..."
"Who ran away.  Afterwards, Saori's mother, the former head of Minato, arranged her engagement to Hiroto. Why Hiroto?"
"Hmm..."


In a world where men are scarce, even for a perpetual noble family, securing a husband isn't easy.  It requires significant effort and funds.  So how was he chosen?


"A man with no female connections...no, that's wrong. Hiroto has..."
"Yes, his second wife. He was involved with her.  To be precise, they were engaged."
"What!?  He cut in on Hiroto's engagement!?"


A man who told Saori he'd be compensated for not doing civic duty.  Yuta, though unsaid, believed Hiroto had a weak sense of social contribution and a lower true male rank.  His current C-rank was likely due to Minato's influence.  Such men often struggle with female relationships.


Hiroto had been interacting with his second wife before Minato bought him, as Takuya had mentioned. But Yuta never imagined they were engaged.


"Why...such a complicated thing?"


To forcefully take a man already engaged, using money and power.  The former head of Minato’s actions seemed irrational.  If she had that much power and money, weren't there easier options? Or were all the eligible men at that time exceptionally good, making Hiroto the easiest to acquire?


"There were easier men to choose if all she wanted was a husband."
"What? There were?"
"Yes.  Yet, Minato insisted on Hiroto."
"Did Saori secretly like Hiroto?"
"No. Saori didn't even know of Hiroto's existence until her mother told her."


The assumption that Saori liked Hiroto was also wrong.  Yuta was utterly confused.


"Why Hiroto then?"
"Why indeed?"
"What?"
"Hehehe. My apologies. The Prime Minister instructed me not to reveal the answer."
"What!?"
"It's best that we shouldn't interfere with the outcome of Saori's...Yukishiro's...problems.  I've told you this much as a thank you for your cooperation and...an apology to Yukishiro."
"An apology?"
"Regarding the matter with Takuya."


While Yuta didn't fully understand the apology regarding Yukishiro and Takuya, he assumed it was about the country's delayed intervention in Takuya's actions.


"Then I shall leave."
"Please convey that I look forward to meeting the Prime Minister."
"Understood."


Hanasaki left, leaving Tomoe and Ayaka.


"I'll meet with the Prime Minister on New Year's Eve."


Most of the conversation with Hanasaki centered on Saori and Hiroto, but that wasn't the original purpose—it was Yuta's question about maintaining a connection with his mother.


"The story about Saori and Hiroto was shocking."
"Yes, quite shocking."
"Is it okay to tell Yukishiro about this?"
"Hanasaki didn't say anything about keeping it a secret from Yukishiro.  Telling her is fine."
"But it's a bad story, isn't it?  About Minato's wrongdoing."
"It is damaging to their reputation.  But wouldn't she find out eventually?  She'll surely learn about it when she becomes the head of Minato."
"True... But why Hiroto?"


Yuta pondered, while Tomoe and Ayaka exchanged glances.  They both had an answer in mind.  Tomoe spoke:


"Yuta...about that..."
