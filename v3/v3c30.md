Episode 30: Consultation

August 30th.

Yuuta returned to his room in the men-only residential area.  His strength and muscle mass had mostly returned, but he wasn't fully recovered.


"I'm so sorry for causing you worry and trouble while I was unconscious."

"It's truly wonderful that you've awakened safely."


When Ayaka received word that Yuuta had lost consciousness and wasn't waking up, she experienced agonizing pain, like her heart was being clutched. She immediately contacted the Boss and Lilith.  She wept at the hospital as Yuuta remained unconscious, but somehow managed to convince Aoi and the others to allow his transfer to Lilith's research facility. That decision was crucial to his recovery.


"I believe Lilith has already explained, but…"

"Yes."

"To reiterate, I've recovered all my memories. I'm still Yuuta."

"Even with your lost memories restored, it's truly wonderful that you're still the same Yuuta-sama."

"I had some memories suppressed, but it was always me from the start."


The two sat on the sofa, their distance that of lovers.  For Ayaka, Yuuta, like Aoi and the others, was a man to whom she had devoted her body and soul. If she were to lose Yuuta, who treats her as his lover, Ayaka felt she wouldn’t be able to live.


"I'm late in telling you this, but things have progressed with Tomoe."

"I heard from Tomoe after you woke up. That's wonderful."


Tomoe was 30 years old this year.  Even if Ayaka and Tomoe were to quickly become Yuuta's lovers and have children, it would still be after Aoi and Yukishiro's wedding next year.  That would make Ayaka 35 and Tomoe 31.  While the advanced medical technology of this world means the risk of childbirth is low, Yuuta wants them to have children as soon as possible, considering their ages.


"Thank you for what you did for Suzune. Please convey my gratitude to the Boss as well."

"The retrial looks likely to begin in September. It's incredibly fast, even unprecedented, but it's what Yuuta-sama wished for. The matter seems to have quickly escalated all the way to the Prime Minister.  Given the nature of the case, the court appears very positive about the retrial, considering it just and meaningful."

"That’s good… I almost let Suzune spend her life in prison because of me."

"Suzune’s mother will be overjoyed."


Just as Yuuta has a mother, so does Suzune. Her daughter had been given a life sentence for sexual violence against a man.  The pain she must feel is indescribable.


"After the retrial is over, but… I want to support Suzune's mother and Nagisa, Suzune's close friend, as much as possible."

"Understood."


Suzune's mother no longer lived in Tokyo, where the men-only residential area is located. After Suzune's incident, it had become too difficult to live there. She now lives in Yokohama, near Kanagawa Prison.


Nagisa, too, disliked living in Tokyo, where she would constantly hear harsh words about Suzune. She moved to Yokohama and lives near Suzune's mother. Suzune’s mother only communicated with Nagisa.  Nagisa continues to work as a kindergarten teacher in Yokohama, but rumors from her previous workplace have spread.  People know she's friends with Suzune, who's incarcerated in Kanagawa Prison, leading to loneliness at her current workplace.


"Yuuta-sama…"


Ayaka trailed off, realizing she shouldn't say what she was about to.  But Yuuta continued the conversation.


"I want to meet my mother."

"..."


Yuuta's confession at Lilith's research facility had been about a young Yuuta longing for his mother's love.


"But that's not allowed in Japan."

"...Yes."

"There's been so much to get to this point. I can't be treated specially."


Many men must long to see their mothers, and vice versa. If Yuuta's special treatment were revealed, it would be a huge problem.


"And then there's Naoto…"

"Takashi-sama's son, yes?"

"Yes. Naoto will be a primary school student in less than two years. The separation from his mother is approaching."

"That…"

"It's unavoidable. I understand. But…"


He wants to help, but he doesn't know how.


"Lilith promised to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister."

"I've heard about that."

"What should I say to the Prime Minister?  I don't even know what to do…"


Ayaka couldn't offer any solutions to Yuuta's troubles. The issue concerns Japan's societal structure.


"I want to help Yuuta-sama, but I don't know what to do either."

"No, please don't be discouraged, Ayaka-san. Just having you listen helps me calm down and think."

"I'm glad you say that. I really don't know what to do… I almost want to consult the Prime Minister myself."

"...Consult the Prime Minister?"


Yuuta pondered Ayaka's unexpected suggestion. Consulting the Prime Minister… could that be a good idea?


"Indeed… consulting the Prime Minister might actually work."

"Eh!?"

"Yes, it could. The Prime Minister of Japan… surely they want what's best for Japan, right?"

"Of course."

"For some reason, I've been thinking that my desires are bad for Japan, so I've been figuring out how to persuade the Prime Minister. But that's wrong.  If I could present it as something good for Japan, and ask for their advice, that would be ideal!"


The Prime Minister has access to more options than anyone else in Japan.


"Ayaka-san! Could you arrange a consultation through the Boss?"

"Y-yes."

"The topic is: How can boys maintain a connection with their mothers?"


It might seem strange to ask the person you're consulting *how* to consult them, but as Yuuta said, the Prime Minister wants what's best for Japan.  Through Ayaka and the Boss, Yuuta wanted to hear the Prime Minister's perspective.


Ayaka, despite the unexpected request, would do anything for Yuuta.  Not acting wasn't an option.


Afterward, they discussed various matters related to the organization's activities.  Yuuta was staying in his room that night, so he bathed with Ayaka, had dinner with her, and slept with her in bed.




Following Yuuta's request, Ayaka acted immediately.  She informed the Boss that she wanted to present Yuuta's consultation to the Prime Minister.  The Boss relayed Yuuta’s request to the Prime Minister.




A few days later, a woman visited Ayaka.


"Ayaka-san, may I speak with you for a moment?"

"Yes."


The woman was Hanasaki from the Men's Division 1st Section, Takuya's current case officer. She was assigned to the Men's Division 1st Section after Takuya was placed under complete state control. Ayaka didn't know her background before that.  Hanasaki led her to a conference room, where Tomoe was waiting.


"Oh? Ayaka-san."

"Tomoe-san?"

"Heehee, sorry.  Getting you both together like this is a bit conspicuous."


After locking the conference room door, the three women sat down.


"Now then, let's get straight to the point."

"...Yes."


Ayaka and Tomoe had no idea what Hanasaki was about to discuss. Even if it was related to Takuya, it likely wouldn't concern them.


"You both know about Yuuta-sama's consultation with the Prime Minister, right?"

"Eh!?"


Ayaka and Tomoe shared Yuuta's concerns.  There was no need to keep it secret.  They had also discussed the Prime Minister's consultation with Tomoe.


"Why… is Hanasaki-san here?"


Their question was why Hanasaki knew about this.


"Why I know… is because the Prime Minister told me."


That was to be expected.  The real issue was why Hanasaki was told about this by the Prime Minister.


"Well, never mind the details.  What matters now is Yuuta-sama's consultation, right?"

"That's true, but…"

"To get straight to it, the Prime Minister wants to ask for your cooperation in answering Yuuta-sama's consultation…"

"Eh? Cooperation?"


The situation was unclear.


"What do you mean?"

"When Yuuta-sama awoke…"


The mention of Yuuta's awakening meant Hanasaki was aware of his unconsciousness and his awakening at Lilith's research facility.


"Apparently, Leila was there, wasn't she?"

"...Yes, she was."

"As a caretaker for Princess Rira, a member of the Mir Kingdom's envoy."

"That's what she said."

"Leila seemed quite… attached to Yuuta-sama."

"That…"


That was certainly how it seemed.  Even on nights when Ayaka and Tomoe weren’t around, Leila had accompanied Rira.  They’d prevented her from entering the research facility under the guise of monitoring Moe, but Leila's words indicated an undeniable attachment to Yuuta.


"Emili and Monica are obsessed with Takuya-sama, but Leila seemed to have lost interest in him. I thought she wasn't interested in Japanese men, but I never imagined her affection would shift to Yuuta-sama."


The situation remained confusing.  Even if Leila was attached to Yuuta, what cooperation was required?


"Hanasaki-san… what kind of cooperation?"

"If Leila makes any contact with Yuuta-sama, I want you to let me know. That's all."

"...Leila contacting Yuuta-sama is impossible! That situation was truly exceptional."

"I understand. If there's no contact, then there's no contact."

"If there's no contact from Leila, does that mean we haven't cooperated?"

"No, that's not what I mean. And the period of cooperation won't be very long."

"Eh? What do you mean?"

"Well, that's our business. If Leila makes any contact with Yuuta-sama, please contact me. Can you discuss this cooperation with Yuuta-sama?"


Simply reporting any contact wasn't overly difficult.  While Leila approaching Yuuta was unlikely, reporting any interaction would be simple and wouldn't put Yuuta in danger.


"Understood. I'll speak with Yuuta-sama and let you know."

"Thank you. Oh, and I think you understand, but… please don't discuss this with anyone else or investigate me…"
