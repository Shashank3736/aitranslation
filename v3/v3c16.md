Episode 16: The Sleeping Prince ⑤

The day after Yuuta was transferred to Lilith's research institute, Aoi and the others went early in the morning, eager to check on his condition.  They arrived at the genetics research institute at 9:00 AM, its opening time, but found Lilith's facility deserted.  Other staff members told them Lilith wouldn't arrive until around 11:00 AM, so they returned to their hotel.

At precisely 11:00 AM, they revisited Lilith's facility.


"His physical health is fine. I agree with Yoshiwara's doctor on that point,"


Lilith, rubbing sleep from her eyes, reported the examination results to Aoi and the others.


"The reason for his unconsciousness wasn't clear from last night's examination.  There are still a few things I'd like to check, and one of them is…"


Lilith looked at Aoi and the others.


"I'm considering letting Suzune meet the sleeping Yuuta."

"What!? Why?!"


Aoi was the first to exclaim. Suzune, the perpetrator of the incident from last year's field trip that caused Yuuta to lose consciousness.  The idea of letting Suzune see Yuuta, even while he was asleep, was unthinkable.


"If the reason Yuuta remains unconscious is connected to the incident when he was in first year of middle school, letting him hear Suzune's voice—a key party involved—might trigger some kind of reaction."

"What if that causes him to become even less responsive?!"

"Can you scientifically prove that it will lead to him becoming even less responsive, Aoi?"

"W-well…"

"It's just a suggestion from me. If you don't like it, that's fine."


Aoi and the others were deeply uneasy about the idea of letting Suzune see Yuuta.  While there was a possibility of some reaction, it was unlikely to be a positive one.


Ayaka, however, held a different view, based on her different understanding of the situation.  Aoi and the others believed Yuuta had undergone memory manipulation. They knew this wasn't entirely true, but it was what Yuuta had told them, so they had to believe it.  Therefore, they couldn't accept the idea of letting Suzune—the embodiment of the painful memories Yuuta was trying to suppress—see him.


Ayaka, on the other hand, knew the truth: Yuuta’s personality had been reconstructed from the genetic information of a man from the Old World—or, in Lilith's words, his soul had been merged.  It was true that Yuuta experienced headaches when he tried to recall the incident, preventing him from remembering it clearly—something even Lilith hadn't foreseen. The soul fusion had been successful.  Therefore, Yuuta shouldn't have any unrecoverable memories, nor should he experience headaches. Lilith hadn't intentionally suppressed his memories.

Then who had?  Only the previous Yuuta—the one she used to call "Yuuta-kun"—came to mind.

It was a drastic measure, but as Lilith suggested, letting Suzune meet Yuuta might elicit some kind of reaction from him. Ayaka didn't think that reaction would necessarily be negative.


"If letting Suzune see him doesn't restore his consciousness or produce any reaction, what do you intend to do?"


Ayaka asked Lilith in a calm voice.


"Besides letting Suzune see him, there are other things we can try.  If he doesn't wake up after trying those, as a last resort…I suggest taking Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom."


Ayaka and everyone else were speechless at Lilith's words.  Why? Why was the Meer Kingdom being mentioned now?


Amidst the confusion, Yukishiro asked, his voice trembling.


"W-why the Meer Kingdom?"

"I know a scientist specializing in memory in the Meer Kingdom. They also have unique equipment. Taking Yuuta there to have his memory region examined by this person might be effective in finding the cause."

"S-so…"


It was an unexpected suggestion.  They didn't dislike the Meer Kingdom, but its culture was difficult to accept. And given what happened with Layla, Aoi and the others felt nothing but unease. No, more than unease—it was outright rejection.


"Taking Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom is undoubtedly worrying. Moreover, you will likely be refused permission to be present when they examine Yuuta's memory region. Can you entrust Yuuta to them?"


Aoi and the others turned pale at Lilith's question. It was an unexpected proposal, one they didn't even want to consider.


"Well, this is a last resort, as I also see it.  I wouldn't want to entrust precious Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom either. So I want to do everything possible beforehand…"


In other words, she really wanted to let Suzune see Yuuta.  Lilith was suggesting that letting Suzune meet him was a more acceptable option for Aoi and the others than sending him to the Meer Kingdom.


"We will take the utmost care when letting Suzune meet Yuuta. If there's even the slightest unusual reaction, we'll remove Suzune immediately. What do you say?"

"…"


Aoi had already been heartbroken by the decision to move Yuuta to Lilith's research facility. She'd barely slept last night, constantly worrying if Yuuta was receiving proper care, if he was in pain.  Even after arriving early in the morning, she couldn't see him. Finally, when she did, he was asleep. Then she was given these unthinkable choices: let Yuuta meet his attacker, or send him to the Meer Kingdom.


Both options tore at Aoi's heart.  She felt a pain she'd never experienced before.  She wanted to scream, to take Yuuta back immediately. If he were under care at Yoshiwara Hospital, maybe he would wake up eventually.  Her heart screamed that rejecting everything and doing what she wanted was best for Yuuta.


However, a voice in her head cautioned her: was that truly the best for Yuuta?  Conflicting voices battled within her; the painful voice of reason clashed with the sweet whisper of instinct, tormenting her.


"Aoi…"


Manami gently embraced Aoi.  Aoi's trembling was more intense than it appeared.  Yukishiro also hugged her.  Embraced by the two, Aoi could no longer hold back her tears.


"W-why…sob…why…"


Why were her only choices so agonizing?  She couldn't, wouldn't, rely on anyone.  The decision rested on her, it was about Yuuta.  As Yuuta's fiancée, the one most deeply connected to him in this situation, she had to decide. Even if Yuuta's consciousness didn't return; even if Yuuta died…


Too mature to be called a girl, but too young to be called a woman. Tears flowed from 17-year-old Aoi’s eyes.  She clutched the handkerchief Yukishiro and Manami had offered, collapsing to the floor.  She stifled her sobs, determined not to cry aloud in front of sleeping Yuuta.


Tears streamed down the faces of Yukishiro and Manami, who supported her.  Tomoe and Ayaka were the same.  Only the sound of suppressed sobs filled the room for a while.


Lilith watched Aoi and the others silently.


No matter how much time passed, Aoi wouldn't calm down.  Both options were unacceptable. Still, after some time, Aoi would rise.  Her tears seemed to stop, but as soon as she tried to speak to Lilith, they would flow again. After repeating this two or three times, on the fourth attempt, she finally spoke in a trembling voice.


"B-before letting Suzune see Yuuta…are there other things you need to check?"

"Yes."

"Please prioritize those."

"Of course."

"If Yuuta's consciousness doesn't return even after that…then…we will let Suzune see him."


Aoi chose to let Suzune meet Yuuta instead of taking him back to Yoshiwara Hospital.  Taking him back was easy, but then she would only be left to wait for him to wake up.  Even the doctors at Yoshiwara Hospital, with their cutting-edge medical technology, couldn't do anything for Yuuta. She could only wait.


Was that really okay?  Aoi rejected the voice in her heart that clung to easy hope, that resisted change.


"We need to bring Suzune here. I believe she's…"


Tomoe finished Lilith's sentence.


"In Kanagawa Prison, a maximum-security facility."

"To bring Suzune here, we need to contact higher-ups. We'll need the Boss's help."

"I'll tell him."


Ayaka would inform the Boss about letting Suzune meet Yuuta. Bringing a criminal serving a life sentence in maximum security out—even temporarily—was problematic.  Official channels wouldn't work, so they needed to do it secretly as an exceptional measure through the Boss.


Ayaka left the room to contact the Boss, and returned after a while.


"The Boss says he needs about three days to talk to the relevant parties."

"Three days is enough time to examine Yuuta."

"But whether Suzune agrees to meet Yuuta is unknown."

"It's an unbelievable request for Suzune. We can't tell her the full situation before bringing her here…we need to persuade her effectively…"


Tomoe, with a strong desire to do it herself, responded to Lilith.


"I'll go.  I have a connection with Suzune…"


Then, Tomoew looked at Aoi.


"Aoi, leave it to me."


Aoi also thought that Tomoew bringing Suzune was the best option.


"Please…Tomoe-neesama."

"Yes."


Thus, they began their efforts to let Suzune meet the unconscious Yuuta.  Ayaka would accompany Tomoew to Kanagawa Prison. Ayaka was worried about Tomoew's ability to remain calm when meeting Suzune alone.


Lilith would continue examining Yuuta.  Aoi and the others returned to their hotel from the research lab where Yuuta was sleeping.  That's when it happened.


Lilith said, as if remembering something.


"Oh, wait a moment."


Aoi and the others stopped.


"Could you come back tonight?"

"Eh?"


They would come anytime if it meant seeing Yuuta, but they didn't understand Lilith's words. Why did she want them to come back at night?


"I'd like you to help with a small examination."

"Y-yes!"


If they could help examine Yuuta, any questions were irrelevant.


"Around 8 PM would be good."

"Understood."

"I'll give you this card. The facility will be closed, but please come in."


Lilith instructed the staff to cleanse Yuuta's body in the evening.
