My anonymous account's growth is insane. It's a bit short, so I was able to post early.
The next morning, it was Saturday, and I had no school. But to maintain a regular schedule, I wake up at 6 a.m. every morning, even on weekends. I live alone, so I need to prepare breakfast. I'm still a little sleepy, but I'll be fully awake in a few minutes. Incidentally, I eat Western food on weekends and Japanese food on weekdays, so today it's toast.

After breakfast and cleanup, I sat on the sofa in the living room. My phone buzzed with notifications. I opened Rimitter—an app with "Nice" and "Re-mitter" functions. "Nice" expresses appreciation or positive feelings, and "Re-mitter" shares that comment with other users.

I had 145 "Nice" and 14 "Re-mitter" notifications. Is that a good start? I'm mostly a viewer, so I'm not sure about typical growth rates, but I'll take it. I have 58 followers. Good or bad? I'm not sure.

"I don't follow anyone, and I don't send 'Nice' or 'Re-mitter' notifications myself..."

I decided to check the comments—something I'd been looking forward to. Of course, I expected some negative comments, but since I enjoy doing this, I don't worry about them. I was happy to see so many comments.

'Amazing muscles!?'
'Great muscles!'
'Whoa!'
'I'm so turned on!'
'I want to hug you from behind!'
'A demon dwells in your back! lol'
'How old are you?'
'I love you!'
'I want to see your abs!'

A smile naturally spread across my face. The comments were overwhelmingly positive—no hate comments at all! I decided to reply to some of them, though I could only really respond to the age question. The reactions are similar to those a man might get for having large breasts.

'I'm 18 years old.'

My birthday is in mid-August, so I'm not even 17 yet. If I gave my real age, I might get doxed. I won't follow back. I *could*, but I didn't expect this kind of response on the first day. If it keeps growing like this, it'll be overwhelming. It's an anonymous account, after all. It doesn't really matter whether I follow back or not; it's my prerogative. I want to reciprocate the kindness, but I'd rather do so through comments and responses to requests.

'So you're a high school student?!'
'More pictures please!'
'I hate working on my days off!'

Yes, I'm a high school student. So, adults have to work on their days off? Being an adult sounds tough. I'll enjoy my high school life to the fullest. I think I'll stop here for now. I secured the camera, waved lightly as if saying "Have a good day," and took a picture. I checked the photo and posted it with a caption:

'Have a good day!'

I took and posted a selfie as a kind of daily login bonus. I believe consistency is key. I'll need to work on variety, but I'll tackle that later.

'See you later!'
'You're my husband!'
'Let's get married!'
'The contrast with yesterday is amazing!'
'Your charm is gone, but you look like a husband now!'
'Even through the mask, you're handsome!'

The comments came pouring in immediately after posting. It seems to be well-received, which is great. I posted a picture with a mask and wig, but they apparently haven't figured out it's a wig. They probably assumed I dyed my hair.

I took off my mask and wig and went back to my usual self. Time to hit the gym. I usually work out for about three hours a day, though mostly for maintenance. Bodybuilding was important in the drama club, so it's become a habit.

Three hours later. It's almost noon, but I want to shower first. Before that, though, I'll take another picture. I lifted my black T-shirt, wiped my face, and snapped a picture. My abs are visible, and my body is slightly glistening with sweat. Modern smartphone cameras are amazing. I posted it with a caption:

'Good sweat!'

*[Image Caption: By Mitemin]*

I edited the picture to hide my face. Ideally, I'd show my face, but adding the mask and wig now would smudge the sweat, so I posted it without them. Of course, I didn't show anything above the neck. I posted it and waited.

'Sweat is erotic!'
'Those abs!!!'
'You have such a sexy body!'
'Ripped!'
'Nosebleed!'
'I'll follow you! Do you do cosplay?'
'The hidden nipples are strangely erotic!'
'I love the veins in your arms and hands!'

Hmm, positive feedback. Cosplay, huh? I'm a complete beginner; I have no idea about that. I don't think I can make my own costume, so I'll have to put it on hold. To meet their requests, I tensed my arms and hands to make the veins pop. Apparently, this is quite erotic to those with that fetish, as it's harder to do with more body fat. I took a picture and posted it.

'So erotic!'
'I want to touch you so badly! Or rather, I want to be touched!'
'You have the ideal body for most women!'
'The slight hairiness is nice too! It gives off a youthful, boyish look.'
'I like the hairy type.'
'I prefer smooth.'
'If you insist, then let's have a war!'
'Any nude pics yet?!'
'Take your clothes off!'

It looks like a war is about to break out, but I wish they'd refrain from verbal abuse. It seems they liked the latest picture. The latter half of the comments are completely filled with explicit requests. Nude pics, huh? I'm not brave enough for that yet. They’re asking me to take my clothes off, but I'm already half-naked!

'What are your hobbies?'
'Where do you live?'
'How tall are you?'
'Do you have a girlfriend?'

The flood of questions is overwhelming. I'll have to think about my hobbies. Household chores take up a lot of my time on weekdays, but I have more free time on weekends. Hobbies, hobbies… I'll just answer them all at once.

'My hobby is working out. I live in Tokyo, and I'm 178cm tall. And no, I don't have a girlfriend.'

That should do it. I hit puberty early, so my height is above average, making it hard to guess my age even if I lied. And even if someone knows what prefecture I live in, no one will stalk me. I'm wearing a black mask and a silver wig, after all. My disguise is airtight. But I guess no matter how well I hide, I’ll probably be found out eventually.

I think I'll end it here for today. What should I do now? I don't have a part-time job; my parents send me money, and if I manage my expenses well, I can save up. The fridge is stocked, and I don't need to go shopping. Hmm, what to do?

"Alright, time to study the common sense of this world."

I studied for about an hour, and I found that sexual regulations have become slightly more lenient. For example, in my previous world, it was illegal for minors under 18 to use love hotels, but that's been lowered to 16. Those 16 and older are considered sexually mature adults, and the term is widely used. However, legal adulthood is still 18. This likely reflects a passive attitude towards sex among men.

This "sexual adulthood" also includes the crime of statutory rape. Those who engage in sexual acts with someone they know is under 16, even if the person is considered "sexually mature," can be arrested. In short, high school students are considered sexually mature adults. To put it simply, it’s a "no-touch" rule for middle schoolers.

That's about the only major difference. Everything else is mostly the same. The laws are largely unchanged. In this world, women are the primary breadwinners, and men do the housework. The reversal of gender roles isn't limited to chastity.

Maybe I should stay home. But I want to eat out, so I guess I'll go. I changed clothes, grabbed my wallet and phone, and headed out. Yesterday was a downpour, but today is sunny. A little humid, but bearable.

There's another reason for going out: to study cosplay. Online information is unreliable, so seeing things in person might be helpful. I'd also like to buy some related books if I find any. I stopped by a family restaurant and then a bookstore, where I got relentlessly hit on and solicited.

"Sorry, I'm busy. I need to keep working on my anonymous account." I thought about the possibility of experiencing reverse-gender-roles and sexual relationships, but I'll need to build up my mental fortitude to approach and charm someone. Go, me! I want to lose my virginity and enter adulthood by summer vacation!

But he didn't know that women are usually the ones initiating courtship and proposals in this world... and he nearly choked on his tea when he discovered his follower count had reached four digits in just two days. Rio was awestruck by the power of internet dissemination.
I can't wait to see a girl and an erotic scene! I'll have to be patient!
