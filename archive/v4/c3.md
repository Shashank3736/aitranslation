**Episode 3: June - Yukishiro**

June is the month of birthdays for Yukishiro, Manami, and Moe. Today is Yukishiro's birthday.

---

The girl who had endured strict education to meet the expectations of those around her sensed the illusion of her father, who she had heard was kind and gentle, in a boy who had done a volunteer livestream. However, she believed there was no path for her to connect with that boy. Struggling and suffering on the path she was on, she found only despair waiting for her at the end. Unable to accept that despair, she strayed from the path and ran away. She ran and ran until she found herself alone. The boy from that day, along with the girl standing beside him, embraced the lonely girl, and as the snow melted, her story began anew.

After Yukishiro's birthday party, Yuuta was at Minato's main residence. Not at the separate mansion prepared for Yuuta, but in the newly constructed master bedroom within the main residence. Yukishiro was not yet the head of the household. She would become the head of the Minato Eitaka family after her wedding to Yuuta, which was just a month away. After that, this would officially become the master bedroom.

"Ufufu~ Yuuta-sama~"

"Yukishiro, you're being so clingy today."

"Do you dislike clingy me?"

"No, I love it."

Like Aoi, Yukishiro had also asked Yuuta to drop the honorifics and call her by her name as a birthday present. This was Yuuta's first time entering the master bedroom in the main residence. Since it was within the main residence, Yukishiro's mother, Saori, and her younger sister, Iori, were also in the same mansion. The mansion was large enough that even if they made noise here, it wouldn't be heard, but it still made Yuuta's heart race.

"Ngh~"

As Yuuta touched Yukishiro, she let out adorable sounds. However, today was a little different. Yukishiro wasn't naked but was wearing a sheer, alluring lingerie set. Though Yukishiro looked beautiful and cute in her lingerie, Yuuta felt something familiar about the texture of the fabric.

(This... this is the Angel Suit, isn't it?)

Yuuta wasn't wearing a ring on his wrist. Even if Yukishiro was wearing the Angel Suit lingerie, it shouldn't have any effect. But something about it bothered him.

(Why is she wearing Angel Suit lingerie...? And who would be sharing the sensations with her?)

Like the Yoshihara group, the Minato group also had members who would stay over at Yuuta's separate mansion to take care of him. But tonight, no one was there.

(Iori-san is under Katsuya's direct command, so it's impossible. Ririka-san also said she wouldn't be staying at the main residence tonight. Akari-san's mother is staying at the main residence, but she has a husband, so it's unlikely. That leaves... Saori-san...)

Saori was also married. However, it had been decided that she would divorce her husband, Hiroto, at the end of July next month. Officially, it would be said that Hiroto had requested the divorce after Yukishiro became the head of the Minato Eitaka family. The public would likely speculate that Hiroto, who had been "bought" by Minato, was now free to seek his own freedom after the headship had been passed down, or that it had been part of some "contract" from the beginning. In any case, Saori would be seen as a tragic woman who had been divorced by her husband immediately after stepping down as head.

(Since New Year's Eve last year, I've been able to meet Saori-san, and we've had a good relationship as family...)

There was one thing that bothered Yuuta a little. It was how Saori treated him.

(Maybe it's just my imagination... but still...)

It was somewhat similar to what had happened with Tomoe. At some point, Tomoe had started acting more flirtatious toward Yuuta. At first, Yuuta thought it was just his imagination. But Tomoe's behavior continued, and one day, he became certain of her feelings.

This situation felt a little like that. But only a little. Tomoe's advances had been clearly flirtatious. Saori had never made such overt advances toward Yuuta. But still... he couldn't help but feel a certain allure.

(Maybe it's just because Saori-san is so charming that I'm imagining things...)

To Yuuta, Saori looked far too young and beautiful to be the mother of Yukishiro and Iori. Given that she was the mother of the beautiful and lovely Yukishiro, who was currently snuggling with him, her beauty was only natural.

"Yuuta-sama~ I have a request."

"What is it?"

"Please... spoil my naughty bottom~"

Yukishiro enjoyed being spanked by Yuuta. When the Minato group girls stayed over at the separate mansion as caretakers, Yuuta would avoid spanking them while they were wearing the Angel Suit. He would only spank them after removing the suit, just before entering them from behind. This was to prevent the sensation from being shared with the other girls wearing the Angel Suit.

But tonight, Yukishiro was wearing the Angel Suit. However, Yuuta wasn't wearing a ring on his wrist.

(Does she want me to spank her over the Angel Suit lingerie?)

Since Yuuta wasn't wearing a ring, even if someone in the mansion was wearing the Angel Suit, the sensation wouldn't be shared. Yuuta concluded that Yukishiro simply wanted to be spanked over her Angel Suit lingerie.

"Yukishiro, your bottom is truly wonderful."

"Ngh~!"

As Yuuta began to caress Yukishiro while spanking her, he made sure not to hit her too hard. He adjusted the strength based on the volume of Yukishiro's moans, trying to find the perfect level of force that would make her feel the best.

"Ahhn~!"

The sound of spanking echoed through the bedroom. Yuuta spanked her with just enough force to elicit pleasurable moans. Any harder, and her moans would stop.

---

At this moment, Yuuta had misunderstood two things.

The first was the strength of the spanking. Yuuta believed that the level of force that made Yukishiro moan in pleasure was the best, but in reality, it wasn't. Yukishiro actually wanted to be spanked harder. The reason her moans stopped when Yuuta hit her harder was because the pleasure was so overwhelming that she couldn't even make a sound. She truly wanted to be spanked harder, but she kept this desire to herself, waiting for the day when Yuuta would naturally want to spank her harder.

(Ahh~ One day... I'll wait until Yuuta-sama wants to spank me harder... harder~)

Though she asked to be spanked, she didn't specify how hard. She would simply refine her charm until Yuuta naturally wanted to spank her harder. Yukishiro's masochistic heart eagerly awaited the day Yuuta would awaken to his sadistic side.

The second thing Yuuta misunderstood was the evolution of the Angel Suit. To be precise, he was unaware of the new development Minato was working on. Minato was developing a new version of the Angel Suit that could share sensations during sexual activities without the need for a transmitter or a ring. The product was still in development, but Yukishiro was wearing the Angel Suit, and even without Yuuta wearing a ring, a device installed in the bed allowed the sensations to be shared. The canopy bed they were using had recognition devices installed at its four corners and the four corners of the ceiling. Any activity performed on this bed would be shared through the Angel Suit.

"Ahhn~! Ahhn~! I'm going to cum~! Yuuta-sama is spanking me, and I'm going to cum~! Ahh!! Ahhh!!!"

As Yukishiro reached her climax from the spanking, she made a lewd and beautiful expression that only Yuuta could see.

"I'm going to enter you, Yukishiro!"

"Yes~! Please! Give me your cock, Yuuta-sama~!"

Deliberately shouting "cock," Yukishiro spread the opening in her lingerie with both hands and thrust out her bottom, her privates already dripping wet. Yuuta grabbed Yukishiro's hips and inserted his fully erect member into her from behind.

"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

"Ngh! Yukishiro, you feel amazing! So good!"

"Ahh~! Ahh~! Ahh~! Ahh~!"

Once Yukishiro's switch was flipped, she often couldn't do anything but moan. When Yuuta told her how good she felt or teased her with slightly stronger words, her moans grew louder and louder. Making love in this bedroom within the main residence made Yuuta worry that Saori and the others might hear Yukishiro's increasingly loud moans. Though the mansion was large enough that it shouldn't be a problem, the thought that they might hear added to Yuuta's excitement.

"Yukishiro, someone might hear your cute moans!"

"Ahhh~!!"

Perhaps because Yukishiro also thought that Saori and the others might hear her moans, she let out even louder, more delighted sounds.

"Ngh!... You're tightening so much! Do you want someone to hear you?"

"Ahhh~!!"

"Or is it this that you want?!"

As he thrust into her from behind, Yuuta spanked her. He intended to spank her with the same force as before, but in his excitement, he hit her slightly harder.

"Ahhhh!! ——————!!"

Yukishiro's hips and bottom twitched violently. It was a more intense spasm than Yuuta had ever felt before.

"Ah! Are you okay? Sorry, did that hurt?"

"Haa... haa... haa..."

Yukishiro shook her head, indicating that it didn't hurt. When she glanced back, her profile showed the face of a woman lost in pleasure. Seeing that face, Yuuta grew even more excited.

"Ah~!"

Slowly, Yuuta's hips began to move again. His fully erect member started to thrash inside Yukishiro.

"Ahh~! Ahh~! Ahh~! Ahh~!"

As Yuuta's member moved inside her, Yukishiro's moans grew louder, and her hips began to move. Realizing that the intense spasms earlier were from pleasure, Yuuta felt relieved and continued to move. He spanked her gently while thrusting into her from behind, aiming for her womb.

(Somehow... I feel more excited than usual... Is it because I'm calling her Yukishiro?)

Like Aoi, Yukishiro was also delighted to be called by her name without honorifics. Thinking that this might be why she was more excited than usual, Yuuta called her name repeatedly.

"Yukishiro, your lewd self is so cute!"

"Ahh~! Ahh~! Ahh~! Yuuta-sama~! Yuuta-sama~!"

"Ngh! I can't hold back anymore! I'm going to cum inside you, Yukishiro!"

"Ahh~! Ahhn~! Don't hold back! Cum inside me! Ahhh~! I'm cumming too!! Nnn!!!~"

As Yuuta released inside her, Yukishiro also reached her climax. His throbbing member released all its seed, and Yuuta covered Yukishiro's back, holding her tightly. They kissed repeatedly, seeking each other's ragged breaths, and gradually calmed down.

---

Yukishiro's wildness that night was extraordinary, and her lewd, alluring temptations kept Yuuta excited throughout. After taking breaks, they engaged in three rounds of passionate lovemaking.

And... for Saori, who was using the Angel Suit and a dildo in the master bedroom, it was also a hot night.

Incidentally, Ririka, who hadn't returned to her family home but was staying in a guest room at the separate mansion, also shared in the hot night using the expanded-range Angel Suit and a dildo... or so it was said.
