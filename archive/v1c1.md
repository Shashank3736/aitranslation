I've started a secret account!

Since my information about this secret account comes from the internet, I haven't considered the darker aspects very much, so please bear with me. m(__)m


The author loves interacting with readers through comments, so if you read the prologue and epilogue and share your own hobbies in the comments, just like me, it'll be fun!  I'll be happy, but fun will win out! lol!

My name is Sanada Rio. I'm a second-year high school student.  I've gotten into something lately. It's creating a secret account in a world where gender roles regarding chastity are reversed, posting erotic photos from a girl's perspective, and streaming videos.  Why did this happen? Let me explain how things turned out. It all started a few months ago…


It's summer, mid-June.  It's the rainy season, and the days have been hot and humid. The weather forecast predicted heavy rain from morning, so I turned off the TV, headed out early, and hurried to school. I got caught in some rain on the way, but I managed to avoid getting completely soaked.


It was raining harder than usual today, making me even more gloomy as I attended classes. It's break time now. To improve ventilation under my uniform, I unbuttoned my shirt to let in some air and try to beat the heat, when my friend, Kimura Yudou, suddenly buttoned it back up, saying, "What are you doing!?"


"Huh? What's up?"


"What's up?! That's indecent!"


"Indecent? What is?"


"That! Unbuttoning your shirt! There are girls here, you know?!"


"So?"


At that moment, I didn't understand at all. I didn't mind unbuttoning my shirt. Because I'm confident in my physique! I'm the ripped, lean, muscular guy I dreamed of being in middle school!  I almost want people to see it.  But I'm holding back.  I'm not an exhibitionist, by the way. But I'd only unbuttoned my shirt. It was so hot and humid.


Then, I looked around and saw the girls in my class averting their gaze.  It was like the reaction of a virgin male high school student.  I'm not exactly a ridiculously handsome guy!, but I have a pretty decent face.  Thanks to my mother, who's incredibly beautiful, a successful career woman working overseas.


My father also works overseas. They both work abroad.  Initially, my father worked overseas, but my mother couldn't function without him—she's essentially inseparable from him—so she followed him and now works at the same company. To put it bluntly, we’re all free spirits.  My whole family, including me.


Incidentally, the Sanada family is a family of four: my father, mother, me, and my older sister, who's a university student.  My sister lives in a dorm, so she only comes home occasionally.  So essentially, I live alone. But anyway, back to the current situation.


I secretly looked around the classroom and saw girls hitching up their skirts and patting them down.  Seriously? Their underwear was completely visible. The underwear I could see was definitely not bloomers; it was actual underwear.  Did the girls in my class usually act this boldly?


(Hmm, black.  Sophisticated.)


"Rio, Rio? Hey!"


"Sorry, sorry, Yudou."


"Are you okay, Rio? If you have a headache, should you go to the health room?"


"No, I'm fine. Thanks."


Hmm, Yudou is still Yudou, but there's one incredibly strange thing.  He's not bringing up any erotic topics at all. Yudou is quite famous among the boys; he's called the "Sexual Dictionary." And combining his last name, Kimura, with "ero," he's called "Ero-mura" (Ero Village).  I call him by his name though.


But Yudou isn't talking about anything erotic at all.  Honestly, I'm starting to worry.  He usually talks about erotic things several times a day.  Basically, he introduces erotic images and videos of girls on secret accounts he finds online, spreading them among us guys. He's the advertising pillar of erotica among the boys.


It's as if those girls aren't bothered at all by having their underwear seen, showing no embarrassment.  And something confirmed my suspicions. The girls started taking off their uniforms and wiping their sweat.  They even took off their bras.  Bare breasts.  Yep, the evidence is in.


(Their sense of chastity is completely reversed.)


I've currently taken refuge in the restroom. Yudou was pretty worried about me. I think I'll dig myself into a grave if I act any more strangely.  While going to the restroom, I peeked into other classrooms.  They were excitedly looking at male gravure photos, and exposing skin and underwear freely because it was hot. They were doing all sorts of things.


As a guy, I almost got an erection, but I managed to hold back.  It’s a very erotic world from my perspective. That's why it can be difficult to live in. Now, my future plan.  I can probably maintain a normal school life.  Although things are a little out of the ordinary. The male-female ratio is almost unchanged; it's just that their sense of chastity is reversed.  Does that mean I'll get hit on a lot? That’s kind of exciting.


*Ring ring*


"Damn! The bell!"


I hurried back to the classroom. By the end of the day, I was incredibly mentally exhausted.  My brain couldn't keep up with the situation.  But I gradually got used to it.  It's simple; just replace the boys from my previous world with the girls here, and I can kind of understand their thinking.


It’s like how we used to think.  Instinctive thinking, or something.  And I heard rumors about how people considered me to have a sexy body and whether or not to confess to me.  Apparently, I'm quite popular.  Muscles seem to be one of the factors that attract women.  Other reactions included people being flustered when I talked to them, like a male high school student approached by a beautiful girl. By the time I got home, I had grasped and gotten used to this world.


"Still, I'm pretty popular in this world. Mostly because of my body, though."


The number of times I was approached on my way home today was 10.  Most of them were older women, saying things like, "You have such a nice body."  I was also hit on three times and solicited by a host club once – quite frequently. I declined everything because it was troublesome.  The women in this world are incredibly aggressive, coming on strong.  It never got this intense in my old world.


That means the men are either extremely passive or completely lacking in sexual assertiveness.  In fact, such topics never came up among the boys at school.  Are all the men in this world starving for attention?  If so, the women in this world are going to have a hard time.


I'm a virgin, and I want to experience intimacy with the opposite sex.  But I have one thing that makes me lack confidence: my sexual skill. I've never had sex.  And I can't practice.  So I can't do it.  I’m so disappointed with how pathetic I am.


"......Huh?"


I was looking at the internet on my smartphone when I found a picture. A guy, not as muscular as me but with somewhat toned arm muscles, had posted a picture. Many accounts that looked female were reacting to it.  Apparently, men's muscles are a major factor in stimulating female arousal.  They were saying things like, "Sexy," and "I want to touch it." By the way, this is a male secret account. Not a female one, probably.


"A secret account… maybe I'll try it."


Confident in my physique, I decided to see how far I could go in this world. I immediately started preparing for the shoot.  I can do photos with just my smartphone; it's easy.  I just need to adjust things so my face isn't visible. Plus, if that guy's muscles, which are still less developed than mine, are causing this much of a stir, I can experiment to see how far I can go—or not.


I decided to post, believing in the reactions of the women and older women around me today. Photos are a good start. But I want to do some shopping first.  Of course, it's for disguises for my secret account.


"First, if I'm going to have a secret account, I need a dedicated account… I should buy colored contact lenses and a wig to hide my identity. I should have a wig at home. If not, I can wear a hood."


I bought disguises: clothes, colored contact lenses, and accessories. I launched Rimitter and created a new account profile.  This is an SNS app, one of the most famous and widely used applications in the world. I decided to venture out into the world in this world with reversed gender roles regarding chastity.  ※This is an exaggeration.


"Hmm, a name. What should I do… Should I use the 'Ma' from Sanada and the 'Koi' from Koizakura and make it Mako?"


I completed the name by adding Mako and the English spelling "magoi." Then, I put on the wig I'd bought – long, silver side bangs – wore a black mask, and put in yellow colored contact lenses for my profile picture.  I'd done a lot of cosplay in the drama club in middle school, so this part was easy. In the drama club, I'd built up my physique and honed my acting skills.  The reason I joined was because I liked being in front of people. I also like other people's reactions.


In the mirror, I saw myself as a character straight out of an anime. My original appearance was completely gone; unless someone knew me, they probably wouldn't recognize me.


By the way, the wig is one I wore when playing a silver-haired knight mob character. It was a gift from my advisor for my first performance.  It’s a precious wig that holds fond memories.  It always makes me feel nostalgic.  And the fit.  Even if the wig is obvious, preventing my identity from being revealed is the priority.


"I was in the drama club in this world too. That was useful."


My main account uses the katakana spelling of my name, Rio. People call me Rio. I proceed with the account setup and check the box that says "I am human."  It's something everyone does. I'm undeniably human, so I check the box.


Now the account is made. I set my profile picture to a determined expression of mine, trimmed it, and created my icon. Then, using the hashtags '#backmuscles #secret account boy', I posted a picture of my back muscles taken with my timer camera along with the words 'Started a secret account'.

If I only need my back muscles, I can take off the mask and wig, but if I’m going to keep this character, it's better to keep them on.  If it becomes a habit, I'll be less likely to forget to put them on when shooting. As it was getting close to sunset, I started preparing dinner. This is how I ended up starting a secret account, the start of a legend.


In the future, I plan to show the secret account gradually gaining popularity. Once the (protagonist) becomes somewhat popular, various female characters will appear. Please wait patiently until then. Regarding the AI illustrations, although I’m making them, they are still AI-generated, so the eye color and physique may differ slightly compared to the first illustration. Please look upon it with a kind and understanding eye.  Positive ratings ☆ and supportive comments will encourage the author. I will post irregularly, but I will try to post as soon as possible.


※Initially, there will be many illustrations of the protagonist's body, but please bear with me.  I will also include illustrations of women, so thank you very much m(__)m And he’s more muscular than I thought, he should have been a bit thinner lol.
