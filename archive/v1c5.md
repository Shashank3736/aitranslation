Classmate Karaoke Party
Sorry I'm a little late. We were having too much fun playing "Doremi Fadon" (a karaoke game) and it delayed my update. I'm really sorry m(__)m

Thanks to everyone, I reached #1 for the day! I started writing 3-4 days ago and climbed to around #13 for the week! This ranking is all thanks to everyone's cooperation and high ratings! I'll keep doing my best!

※I've slightly changed the number of people per karaoke room.
Because of exams, I temporarily stopped my side account activities to focus on studying. Finally, the exams are over, and I can finally rest. My school is a prestigious one, so we put a lot of effort into studying. Maintaining a high rank is quite tough, and since I was slacking off with my side account, I had to expect my rank to drop a bit. It's completely my fault. I cried out in my heart:

(Ugh... I messed up! My side account was surprisingly fun, and I neglected my studying, dropping about 10 places! Damn it!)

By the way, there are about 200 students in my grade, so my current rank is 27th. But once the end-of-term exams are over, it's graduation ceremonies and summer vacation! How fast time flies. It's been a little over a month since I came to this world. I've already adapted to this world, but the number of guys hitting on me and trying to recruit me hasn't decreased; it seems to have increased. Why?

"Well, shall we go home?"

"Hey, hey, Sanada-kun"

"Hm?"

Today, the end-of-term exams finished, and we were dismissed around noon. I stood up from my seat, and when I was about to leave, I was called by a girl in my class. It was Matsumura Nanami-san. Among the girls, she's called "Matsuchchi"—it sounds like slang.

She looks soft and fluffy, but she's the mood maker of the class. She's bright, cheerful, and friendly to everyone, making her easy to get along with. She has twin tails, which is fashionable. She ties her hair in two, using a ribbon or something, and it looks cute. It’s surprising that Matsumura, who is practically the center of the class, would talk to someone like me.

"We're having a karaoke party to celebrate the end of exams. Will you join us?"

"Um, sure."

"Really?! Yay~! Everyone, Sanada-kun's coming!"

"Seriously? As expected of Matsuchchi!"

I didn't have any reason to refuse, and deepening my relationships with my classmates is important, I suppose. I haven't changed classes since first year, so I'm not sure if it's really necessary though. A few boys are also participating, and most of the karaoke songs seem to be the same, so there are several songs I can sing. I also have requests for song covers, so I consider this a good rehearsal. It's more fun with more people than going alone.

So, I decided to participate in karaoke. Maybe because I was with my classmates, I didn't get hit on or recruited. I guess people underestimate me when I'm alone. Being a student might also be a factor.

And I finally understood why I've been getting recruited by host clubs. If you're a legal adult, you can work in the entertainment industry, and host clubs are no exception. Why did I just realize this now? I knew about the pick-up attempts, but I didn't expect those kinds of recruitment attempts. I'd been wavering, but I need to be careful.

Then we arrived at the karaoke place. It was a weekday afternoon, so it wasn't crowded. However, since each room has a limited number of people, we decided to split up. I agreed with this. But the way they divided the people was strange! Well, there are few boys participating.

There are about 13 boys and 21 girls, and 7 rooms. We decided to put 2 boys in 6 rooms, 1 boy in 1 room, and 3 girls in each of the 7 rooms.

"Isn't it unfair that I'm the only one in a room by myself? What? Are the boys bullying me?"

"No, that's not it! Don't misunderstand!"

"Our conclusion is that since Rio gets along so well with girls, he'll be fine alone."

"What about my opinion?"

'We can't handle multiple girls alone. So it was by elimination.'

If you're going to act all conspiratorial like that, I'd rather not participate. I don't want the girls to feel pressured to have me there, so I glanced at the girls, but they didn't seem to care at all. Are women in this world too kind-hearted?

I secretly asked them "Why did you participate?", and they said it's better to get along with the class a bit... What nonsense. Too many complaints. It seems women in this world will have a hard time.

"So, is this okay for the room assignments?"

"OK" "No objections." (I really wanted to be with Sanada-kun though...)

"No entering rooms other than the assigned ones. It’s a request from the staff."

"Roger." "If you want to talk, just use video call." "OK"

"Let's disband then!"

As soon as Matsumura-san said that, she pulled my arm and took me to a room. There were four of us in this room, including Matsumura-san. I noticed something when the girls gathered earlier. I don’t know why, but everyone had become incredibly beautiful... no, gorgeous girls. Of course, they still retain their features from the previous world, but they've become significantly more beautiful. Maybe I've started hallucinating.

Come to think of it, the women in the city seemed to be quite beautiful. If the number of beautiful women in my previous world is 1, it's about 40 here. About 40 times more. What? Did their genes evolve to become more beautiful in order to attract more men?

Or why didn’t I notice this before? Oh, yeah! I did have some doubts, but frankly, I was so focused on my side account that I didn't even look. Ugh, I'm an idiot. Even though I'm trying to learn about this world, I didn't even bother to observe it.

"Sanada-kun, what's wrong?"

"No, I'm fine, I was just thinking."

"Hey, hey, Sanada-kun, you have nice muscles."

Matsumura-san said that while looking at my arm. It's true, I'm wearing a short-sleeved shirt because it's summer, so my arm muscles are clearly visible. Could this be the reason?! No, no, surely they wouldn't try to hit on me just because of my arm muscles... probably. But women in this world seem to have a hard time, so maybe I can offer a little service.

"Want to touch them?"

"Re-Really?! Is it okay?"

"Sure."

"Wow, they're hard, thick, and strong."

(I think the expression is a bit indecent, so my heart must be dirty.)

"Hey, Matsuchchi, your expression is indecent!"

Apparently, it wasn't just me. Giggling was Kinpatsu (blonde), a cute girl with a gal-like style. Her name is Shinohara Maika. She's sensitive to cosmetics and trends and is a bit of a follower of fashion. Outside of school, she wears shorter skirts, and if I lower my gaze a little, I can almost see her butt. She often hangs out with Matsumura-san. If their family relationships are the same as in my old world, they've been childhood friends since kindergarten.

And finally, there's the black-haired, boyish girl, Uchiumi Haruka. She's in the archery club, and despite being a second-year student, she's the ace of the team. She's a top student with excellent grades. She's known for her athleticism and cool demeanor. She's got the kind of cool look that makes guys fall for her. The girls say she has a really athletic body. Why is this group so amazing?

And Matsumura-san is freely touching and playing with my arms. It's far from a massage, but the thought of being touched by girls makes me a little excited. If I weren't a virgin, maybe I'd be more relaxed.

"Amazing. You really have great muscles. Can you make a bicep peak?"

"I want to touch them too, Sanada-kun!"

"Shinohara-san. Call me Rio. It's easier, right?"

"Then Rio-cchi! Call me Maika. Hey, can I touch them too?"

"Sure. Here."

"Wow, amazing muscles. Are you a bodybuilder or something?"

"No, it's just a hobby. I was also in the drama club in middle school. And we did a lot of action stuff, so..."

"Hee~"

Then another girl, Uchiumi-san, started fidgeting. She was holding a microphone and kept glancing at my body. Does she think I haven't noticed?

"Uchiumi-san. Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Eh?! No, it's..."

"Haru-chan is a tsundere, so she can't say she wants to touch them..."

"Sh-Shut up!"

"Haru-cchi's stuttering."

"She's cute even when she can't hide it."

"Even Sanada-kun..."

Uchiumi-san, exposed as a tsundere, became teary-eyed and shy, shrinking away. She seemed to be so composed and always calm, but she's just a cute girl after all. I feel like I've found a surprising side of her.

"I can ask too! Sanada-kun, let me touch them too!"

"Don't yell into the microphone like that."

"You might be heard outside!"

"It's like a declaration of love!"

"Well, there's no problem if you want to touch them."

My arms are already occupied by Matsumura-san and Shinohara-san, so there's no space left on my arms. The only places left are other parts of my body. It's like I'm being picked?

"I want to touch your serratus anterior."

"Haru-chan, where's that?"

"Haru-cchi's a muscle fetishist?!"

"Isn't the serratus anterior the muscle under the armpit?"

"How do you know that?"

"From weight training. I'm training a lot."

"What should we do with the arms?"

"Like a safe in baseball."

I stretch my arms out to the sides in a "safe" pose. I thought my arms would get tired, but because the other two are absorbed in touching them, I'm actually being supported. No, they're slowly moving up from my forearms to my biceps.

"Th-Then, excuse me."

(?!)

Uchiumi-san sits on my lap. No, this is a full-on face-to-face sitting position! Why this position?! There were other options! She's touching me around my armpits and it's quite ticklish! Uchiumi-san smells amazing. I'm getting so excited.

(Calm down, me, calm down! If I get an erection in this position, I can't explain it away! Even in a world with reversed chastity, it's embarrassing to get an erection in front of girls in my class! That's right, let's change the subject! ...Damn it! I can't think straight because of Uchiumi-san's scent! Wait... what am I doing here?)

"Hey, we came here to karaoke, right? Aren't we going to sing?"

'Ah!'

"Did we all forget?!"

It seems everyone here had forgotten that we were at a karaoke place. That was close, I almost crossed the line in a karaoke box. When I looked closely, there was a sign saying that the karaoke box shouldn't be used for anything other than karaoke. While doing something erotic in a soundproof karaoke box is tempting, it would be bad if we were caught. I felt mentally exhausted even before we started singing.
Finally, the girls make their appearance! The microphone is a little messed up, but please forgive it as it's AI illustration! I will keep working hard on the updates!
