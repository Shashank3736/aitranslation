**English Translation and Corrections:**
I plan to post this around a little after 10 PM tonight.
A week has passed since then. It's been about two and a half weeks since I started my alt account. I have two pieces of good news. First, after enabling the gift function, I received so many gifts that I'm surprisingly struggling to find space for them all. I hope they all fit in my room!
Secondly, I was informed that my dedicated message board is complete. It seems to only feature my photos. I received a message asking for permission to use my photos on their site, and I was surprised when they told me they were creating a message board dedicated to me! Also, I'm surprised at how many hardcore fans I have. The message board currently looks like this:
“Mako is super hot, I’m in love!”
“His face is so handsome and his figure is amazing, it's outrageous!”
“Finally, you enabled the gift function! Seems like many didn’t know about it, lol.”
“And you always create such stimulating situations, it really gets me going.”
“The situations are important, but the way he acts is amazing too, right?”
“Anyway, I'm sending a cosplay costume!”
“I want to lick his muscles~~~”
“It’s a flood!”
“I can't believe such a hot body hasn't become more famous!”
“Modern high school girls don't even get to see this. These days, most pools are gender-segregated.”
“Thanks for the info!”
“I really want to have sex. I want to be dominated! No, I want to dominate!”

So, it's less about discussions about me and more of a place for people to release their desires. My room is filled with tons of Amazon delivery boxes overflowing with gifts. I'm really happy, but it might be a bit too much.
“I should take a picture of this before I open them and post it.”
I took a picture of the piled-up boxes and posted it on Rimitter.
“I received gifts! I’m going to open them now!”
“Too many, lol!”
“Are you moving house, lol?”
“Everyone’s contributing a lot, haha, me too.”
“Please do a live stream!”
“I strongly agree with the above!”
“Same here!”
“I bet there’s nothing good inside, lol.”
There are so many requests for a live stream, should I just do it? No, maybe I should hold off for now. It's a good day to start, but I need to mentally prepare myself. Maybe I'll post pictures one by one?
“I won’t do a live stream yet. I'm not mentally prepared.”
“Our wish wasn’t granted?”
“Well, going straight from photos to a video is a bit high level.”
“My voice might give me away…”
“But the gift opening already feels like it's going to be amazing!”
“I believe in your eventual livestream!”
My followers are all so kind. They understand my feelings. I want to fulfill my followers' requests as much as possible, but I hope they understand if I can't do it because I'm not mentally prepared. I took out a cutter and started cutting the tape on the boxes. There's something I've been wondering about.
Men's sexual proactiveness. My previous guess was just speculation, so I think asking my followers is best. I'll post a poll on Rimitter.
“This is a sudden poll, so only answer if you can. Are men proactive about sex, or not? I want opinions from a female perspective.”
“No.”
“No way.”
“I don't often hear about that.”
“Even with AV actresses and gravure idols, many apparently do it reluctantly because of money. It's almost nonexistent.”
“They're definitely dry.”
“So they mostly use drugs to get an erection.”
“It seems quite difficult. I don't know because there are no men around.”
It seems like they're practically starving. The alt account I saw before, the one that made me start my own alt account, it turned out that the girlfriend had posted pictures from her boyfriend's trainer diary without his permission, causing a minor flame war. Whether that couple broke up or not is unknown.
This means I was just mistaken in thinking men also have alt accounts; they are extremely rare. Looking back, I might have never seen a male alt account. That's why my follower count grew so rapidly. It makes sense.
Even if I'm confident in my body, that kind of growth isn't normal. Normally, it grows much more slowly. But I was so busy with my own things that I didn't search for other male alt accounts. My thoughts have wandered again. I need to focus.
The plan for today is: gift opening → post photos → reply to comments with gratitude on the previous post.
“Let's start with the first one!”
“Exciting!”
“wktk!”
“I wonder what’s inside?”
“Will it be a demon or a snake?”
“Shouldn't that be ‘evil’ instead of ‘snake’?”
While the comments poured in, I silently opened the boxes. The first one I picked up was a small box, or rather, a package. I don’t know what’s inside, but it’s better than starting with the biggest ones. When I opened it, there were a lot of cards inside. There were 20 of them, each a ¥10,000 gift card. A total of ¥200,000. I posted this immediately.

“Mako received ¥200,000!”
“The person who sent this is definitely a hardcore Mako fan, lol!”
“I sent it. Was it not enough?”
“It was you, lol!”
“That’s crazy! Well, it is enough though, lol.”
“That’s insane from the start, lol.”
“Well, for a guy who got over 10,000 followers in less than a month, this is possible... right?”
“Mako's camera is slightly shaky from the shock, lol.”
“Thank you for the gift cards! I will use them carefully.”
“The comment is normal, but he must be shocked.”
“I really want to see his reaction on video.”
I chose what seemed like a relatively normal package, and yet something so impactful immediately appeared. I’m a little worried about how to use this. Okay, next! I chose a smaller one this time. This time, a ring was inside. It looks like a diamond, but I want to believe it’s glass. I’ll post it.

“A ring, I don’t know if it’s a diamond or glass…”
“A ring, lol!”
“It's an engagement ring, lol!”
“It’s a shame there’s no appraiser around.”
“The love of the followers gets heavier every time he opens a small one, lol.”
“The hardcore fans are just too crazy, I can’t even laugh.”
“Thank you for the ring. I can’t wear it, so I'll cherish it as a display.”
“I can tell from the comments, he’s seriously struggling, lol.”
“Anyone would be struggling, lol. Especially a new alt account.”
If I open a smaller one, something even crazier might come out, so I’ll try a slightly larger one this time. It’s surprisingly heavy? I opened it, took a picture of the contents, and posted it. Seeing what was inside the box, I was relieved and thrilled at the same time.
“Ooh! Finally something normal!”
“It’s a [Game Console name]!”
“I can sense their intention to ask for game streams!”
“What game is it?”
“The game is ‘Great Battle Splasher’!”
“As expected, but great taste!”
“That's a classic!”
“But can Mako-kun play games?”
“If he's bad, it will be cute.”
“I can do a game stream, but maybe during the summer break. I have end-of-term exams next week.”
“That’s right, you’re still a high school student.”
“Unpleasant memories are resurfacing.”
“I’m definitely failing.”
“Will Mako-kun be okay?”
“I'm good at studying, so I’ll be fine. I’m in the top 10% of my grade.”
“Smart and horny is the best!”
“This is what they call a gap moe, huh?”
“It's like those who seem serious are the most extreme.”
“There’s really a person like that from an erotic manga.”
“Thank you for the game console~! I’ll use it when I do a game stream sometime~!”
I talked a bit too much, but whatever. Speaking of games, I sometimes played on my phone or at arcades, but I didn’t have a game console. I was too busy getting used to housework. I'm used to it now, but I often felt left behind when everyone talked about games, so the thought of joining in makes me excited.

“Let’s keep going! It's getting fun!”
“He's so hyped, lol.”
“His happiness is leaking from the comments, lol.”
“He seems so happy after receiving the game console.”
“Cute!”
“Cool, cute, hot. Is he perfect?”

“Now, this thin one. It's pretty light.”
I posted a picture. The present was like a letter. I opened it by hand, not with a cutter. A letter came out. It’s probably a fan letter. By the way, I haven't looked at the contents yet. I'll post it first.

“I received a letter! It looks like a fan letter, judging by the cover.”
“A fan letter?”
“I hope it is a fan letter…”
“A flag has been raised!”
“Please, let it be an ordinary fan letter!”
“Stop raising flags!”
“I'll open it now.”
I peeled off the tape and took out the paper with the contents written on it. It’s like a matryoshka doll. Then, a piece of paper fell out. No, it’s not paper, it’s a picture. It’s clearly harder material than normal paper. Looking at the photo, there's a naked woman, thrusting upwards to emphasize her genitals, spreading her legs, and showing her vagina. It's a full-frontal nude photo. I can't show this. My account will be deleted. I'll just comment…

“…”
“What’s wrong, what’s wrong?”
“The comments suddenly stopped, lol!”
“Your Rimitter is working fine.”
“Oh (I understand)”
“That was fast!”
“Um, thanks for the nude photo. By the way, there was nothing else in the letter besides the photo.”
“F***ING LOL”
“Too much, lol.”
“Sending it directly instead of online, lol.”
“[Game console name] and this is amazing, lol”
“It’s literally heaven and hell, lol.”
“I’ll cherish it, but I don’t want to be banned, so I won’t post the picture. I’ll keep it as a display item.”
“Use it?!”
“Mako-kun’s comment is also quite insane, lol.”
“The person who sent the nude was lucky, lol.”
“A flood of nude photos is coming, lol.”
“Why is his statement so sexually suggestive?”
It seems like they're enjoying my reactions. Actually, I want to enjoy it, but whatever. Good reactions are more fun. That's not just me, it's the viewers too. If everyone is satisfied, then it’s fine, I started to think.
“Next, next!”
I continued opening the boxes one after another. After that, it was a parade of cosplay costumes. They were all different, so I should have plenty of posting material. Because it’s summer, I even received swimsuits. Boomerang pants, too. And lined up before my eyes were four sex dolls.
“Too many sex dolls, lol!”
“You can enjoy them four times a day, lol!”
“No way, a man is usually done after one time, lol.”
“It's essentially a five-person party, lol.”
“I’ll cherish these someday too. I’ll put them away in the boxes for now.”
“You'll use them?”
“It makes the senders happy to know that their gifts are properly used.”
“Please livestream yourself using them!”
“And send them to me!”

It seems like the men in this world can only handle one time. If men are quite sexually passive, then the high demand for erotic male streamers makes sense. They're well-received and easily respond to requests, but there are many who are extreme in turn. I need to be more careful about stalkers and such.

I finished opening all the gifts and ended today's post. I arranged the contents, took a picture, and posted it on Rimitter. I gained 2,000 followers today alone. Today's post received a total of 30,000 likes and 11,000 reposts, which apparently caused the rapid spread. I was completely hooked, but I stayed up late and unusually overslept the next day.

I plan to update around 10 PM tomorrow. Encouraging comments and high ratings motivate the author, so please give it a "click" if you can. There are no illustrations this time, but I will include them only when the situation allows and I can create good illustrations. I'm sorry if I can't meet your expectations.
