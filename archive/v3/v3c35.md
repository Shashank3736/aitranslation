Episode 35: Kisarazu
October 16th.

Yuta and his friends spent a fun time at Inma Land as planned that morning, concluding their school trip.

They traveled back separately.

Yuta, along with Tomoe and Ayaka, went to the Meer Kingdom Special District in Kisarazu.

Aoi, Yukishiro, Manami, Akari, and Moe waited nearby, in a large limousine, ready to rush to Yuta’s aid if needed.

Yuta and the others arrived at the hotel’s main entrance at a little before 5 PM.

Hanasaki greeted them, and they immediately went up to the top floor in the elevator.

Several individuals who seemed to be Japanese government officials were stationed inside the hotel. Yuta assumed they were bodyguards to protect him as they proceeded to a room at the back of the top floor.


“We have brought Mr. Yuta.”


The top-floor room was arranged for a meeting, and Takuya was waiting, seated on a sofa.


“Hello. Long time no see.”
“Yeah.”


Takuya only responded with a single word, remaining seated. Yuta, unfazed, sat opposite him. Hanasaki stood behind Takuya; Tomoe and Ayaka stood behind Yuta.


“Since we're not here for casual conversation, let's get straight to the point.”
“That works for me.”
“What I want to ask you, Takuya, is about when you visited Yukishiro’s father last August. What did you talk about with Yukishiro’s father? Can you tell me what kind of person he was?”
“Huh? Why are you asking about that…? Oh well. Yukishiro’s father… he was an ordinary man, I guess. He met with me despite my unexpected visit, but I bet he just wanted me to leave quickly. He had a polite smile, but I bet he felt differently inside.”
“What did you talk about?”


Although Yuta disliked being called Yukishiro by Takuya, he decided to ignore it and listen.


“It was about what kind of life he’d led as the husband of the Minato family head. Do you know the story of Yukishiro’s mother? How those two got together?”
“I know…officially, it's a love marriage.”
“Officially. Anyone can figure it out with a little research. Her father was a man bought by Minato.  And he lived comfortably, thanks to being bought. But only within Minato’s cage.”
“Cage? Didn't he choose to live in a villa in a resort?”
“He had no other options within Minato’s cage. He could only live within what was given to him by a woman. I hate that kind of life.”
“….Let’s leave your thoughts aside for now, Takuya. Did Yukishiro’s father say anything about Saori?”
“Ah… did he say anything? …Ah, yes.  Because it was officially a love marriage, I used that as a pretense. Then he said, ‘We never loved each other,’ and broke that pretense himself. From there, I started hearing about his life as a man bought with money.”


We never loved each other.
Not a love marriage, but a relationship bought with money.
I know that.


(Even so, Saori tried to cultivate love over time?)


“Was Yukishiro’s father the only one living in the villa you visited?”
“No, he said he had a second wife and a lover. I haven't met them, though.”
“Did you hear anything about him meeting Saori at that villa?”
“Hmm?  Uum…that didn’t come up. Whether he met her or not.”
“What was Yukishiro’s father’s impression of, or feelings towards, Minato, from your perspective, Takuya?”
“Towards Minato…he had no impression or feelings, I guess.”
“None?”
“Yeah. He didn’t care. He wasn't interested in me or Yukishiro at all. He showed complete indifference to the man his daughter directly served.”


In this world, fathers often show little interest in their children born to their wives or lovers. Since they rarely participate in raising children, their lack of interest is understandable. However, it's not always complete indifference. They might be happy to hear about their child's growth. If the man their daughter directly serves is right in front of them, wouldn't they at least show some interest and listen to what he has to say?


“Were his second wife and lover women he knew before being bought by Minato?”
“I don’t know about the lover, but he said something about his second wife having known him before.”
“Did they have any children?”
“Ah… yes.  When he talked about living at the villa, he mentioned children born to his second wife and lover.”
“I see…”


(Is he only uninterested in Yukishiro?)


“Did he mention anything about Yukishiro’s younger sister, Iori?”
“Huh? Why would he mention her sister Iori?”


(It’s not surprising that Iori wasn't mentioned in my conversation with Takuya. But if he had even a little interest in his children, he might have asked about how she was doing…)


“Is there anything else that stands out to you, Takuya?”
“Let me see… Ah, yes, there’s one thing. When I brought up volunteer work, he made a disgusted face.”
“A disgusted face?”
“Yeah.  That father was C-rank, you see. When I asked about what kind of volunteer work he was doing to maintain his C-rank, he made a very disgusted face and said he didn’t want to talk about volunteer work. Well, it would be Minato-related volunteer work, right? Maybe he didn’t want to talk about Minato-related volunteer work that he was forced into because he was bought? He should have just refused to be bought in the first place. Generally, women…”


He’s indifferent to his daughter Yukishiro.
He dislikes Minato-related volunteer work.
He doesn’t seem like a good father to Yukishiro, yet Yukishiro believes him to be a kind and gentle father.  That’s what those around her taught her when she was young.


The time is 5:20 PM.
The conversation about Yukishiro's father took a little longer as Takuya started sharing his own opinions.
Having heard enough information from Takuya, Yuta decided to end the conversation.


“Thank you for telling me about it. It was a good reference for interacting with Yukishiro’s father.”
“That’s a strange way of thinking. There’s no need to consider interacting with the father in the first place.”
“This is just my way. I'll transfer the promised money.”


Takuya didn't care about Yuta’s reasoning as long as he received the promised money.


“Well then. Take care.”
“Hmph! I don’t need to hear that from you.”


Takuya’s personality hadn’t changed much, still working under the complete control of the government, but it was good that they were able to have this conversation, even if it was for money.  A shouting match that prevents a discussion is the worst-case scenario.


With no reason to stay longer, Yuta, Tomoe, and Ayaka got into the car and immediately went to where Aoi and the others were waiting. It all went according to plan, and Tomoe and Ayaka breathed a sigh of relief.


“Thank you.”
“It’s good that everything ended safely.”
“Layla didn’t try anything.  Though, doing anything in that security setup would have been impossible.”


Upon leaving the special district, they joined Aoi and the others.  Yuta got into the limousine and, along with Aoi and the others, began their journey back to Tokyo.


The time is 5:30 PM.
A car stops at the back entrance of the hotel.
Layla, who had been waiting in the first-floor reception room until Yuta’s car arrived, immediately went to the back entrance upon learning of its arrival to greet Yuta as he got out of the car.


“Huh?”


But it wasn’t Yuta who got out of the car.
A woman in a suit that he didn’t recognize got out.


“Ms. Layla, is it?”
“Y-Yes. Who are you…?”
“I would like to speak with you, so please come with me.”
“What?”
“I am… this.”


The woman shows her police badge.


“W-What’s going on?!”
“You will understand if you come with me.”
“This is a special district!”
“Even in a special district, the laws applied to crimes are those of Japan.”
“Cr-Crime?!”


Another woman in a similar suit comes out of the hotel’s back entrance.


“Found it.”
“Good work.”
“Ah!”


It was the incense they had placed in the reception room.
It was prepared to give Yuta an illegal aphrodisiac.


“Just the incense?”
“Yes.”
“Then did you have the one for tea?”
“Ah… uh…”
“Don’t worry. You already have a return order to Meer Kingdom. The result will be the same… Come on, let’s go.”
“I-I don’t want to!”


Layla is subdued and taken away in the car. Hanasaki watches this from a third-floor window. After Layla is taken away, Hanasaki goes to Takuya. Takuya was in his room, canoodling with Emily and Monica.


“Mr. Takuya.”
“What?”
“Regarding Ms. Layla, we received another notice that she is to return to Meer Kingdom immediately under an order.”
“Oh, is that so?”
“Yes. She left a while ago to return to Meer Kingdom.”
“Without even saying goodbye… Oh well.”


For Takuya, it was simply one less person to spend his money on right after he’d received the payment. As long as he could have fun with Emily and Monica, that was all that mattered.


“Should we extend the school trip? We can adjust the schedule for the next volunteer work.”
“Really!? Alright! Let’s go somewhere then. There’s nothing to do here except look at the sea.”
““Yes♡””


Takuya smiled, pleased to hear such convenient words from Hanasaki, which was rare.  Hanasaki’s face also held a smile as she watched him.


Hanasaki and the others had been monitoring Layla’s actions the previous night. They anticipated she would try to get illegal aphrodisiacs.  The information they gained was useful.


They confiscated the illegal aphrodisiacs she intended to use on Yuta.  Obtaining concrete evidence was also a significant achievement. They also found the location of the warehouse storing the illegal aphrodisiacs, but they won’t raid it immediately.  They could do so if they mobilized people at this moment. However, illegal aphrodisiacs have infiltrated the deep darkness of Japan. Who on the Japanese side is involved? They must cut off the source; otherwise, it will just be a repeat of the same thing. The location of the illegal aphrodisiac warehouse discovered this time will be used for future investigations.


They can’t stop trading with Meer Kingdom even with this illegal aphrodisiac issue. The queen will not admit involvement in the illegal aphrodisiacs.  If they tried to make her admit it, they would lose the import of rare metals. Hanasaki believes that this incident will be framed as Layla’s individual crime, not Meer Kingdom’s, to extract some benefit from Meer Kingdom. Layla will be handed over to Meer Kingdom once negotiations are settled. The order for her temporary return from Meer Kingdom also means that even if she returns as a criminal, it wouldn’t make much difference, from what Hanasaki knows.


Layla’s mother, Seyla, will know about this tomorrow. While Seyla hadn’t received an order to temporarily return, she may return home with her daughter.


Emily and Monica must suspect something strange from Hanasaki’s words earlier. They were excited about going out with the money Takuya had acquired, but what were they thinking deep down? Though they’re close to Takuya, they remain members of Meer Kingdom.  They belong to the shadowy organization. Japan knows that Emily and Monica are candidates for the shadow organization who have undergone combat training.


Emily and Monica have become involved in the smuggling of illegal aphrodisiacs. They won’t be able to live happily with Takuya. Meer Kingdom wouldn’t allow it.


If there’s a possibility... Hanasaki, who has been Takuya's handler and has watched Emily and Monica, could, as a member of the Japanese “management” side, tell the Prime Minister... that they could keep Emily and Monica by Takuya’s side through the deal for Layla’s incident.  As candidates for the shadow organization, Emily and Monica at 17 probably don't have much information about the Meer Kingdom's shadow organization. They lived in Japan since middle school alongside Layla, so all the more so.  Unless the information Emily and Monica have is unacceptable to Meer Kingdom.


Hanasaki decided to tell the Prime Minister about Emily and Monica.
