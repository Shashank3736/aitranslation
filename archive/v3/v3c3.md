Episode 3: Class Trip ③

"It's so beautiful."

"Thank you."


Yukishiro, guided by Manami, arrived at Yuta's room.  Expecting to find Aoi there, she found only Yuta.  She was alone with him, showing him her kimono.


"How was your reunion with everyone?"

"Everyone was delighted. Thank you so much."

"I'm glad. Please, have a seat."

"Excuse me."


They sat opposite each other across a table.  The atmosphere was pleasant, and they were able to talk. However, a distance remained between Yukishiro and Yuta, much like the table separating them.


(I need to take a step forward…)


She recalled Manami's words.  It's normal for women to appeal to men. Some appeal with their looks and figure, others with money or power. Yukishiro, however, excelled in everything.


(I need to show my resolve… But… No way, I…)


Since interacting with Yuta, Yukishiro had realized something about herself.


(I… I'm at a loss when dealing with men…)


As a middle school student, Yukishiro had charmed any man she encountered, portraying the perfect lady. She knew how to praise, flatter, and even fawn over them. She believed her interactions with Takuya were going smoothly.


But she couldn't do it with Yuta. The words of praise, flattery, and coquetry wouldn't come.


"Yukishiro-san, you're beautiful, of course, but I think you're also very charming."

"S-Such…"


When Yuta praised her, she blushed crimson, her head bowed. Under the table, she clutched the summer camellia handkerchief he had given her, trying to calm herself.


(If it were the old me…)


If a man had praised her, she would have thanked him and naturally praised him in return. That's what she would have done.  Instead of sitting opposite him, she would have sat beside him, confidently displaying her body to tempt him, wearing a mask of smiles.


"Y-Yuta-sama's kindness, I am grateful every day."

"I'm happy if it brings even a little peace to Yukishiro-san's heart."


It was far more than a little. Yuta's gentle voice brought Yukishiro more peace than anything else.


(I've clung to Yuta-sama's gentle voice so many times.)


During her first year of high school, whenever her heart was troubled, Yukishiro found solace in Yuta's voice.  But it was only her clinging to him; he was unaware of her feelings.


(It's one-sided…  H-Hold on!  I can't think like this. I can't waste Manami-san's consideration. For Manami-san's sake…, and for Akari and the others!)


Yukishiro reaffirmed her position. She was still the heir to the Minato family, destined to become the head of the house – if Iori proved incapable.


And for those who admired her and trusted Minato, she had to lead Minato as a strong leader.  She told Akari that Minato's reputation didn't matter, but there were still things she had to protect.


(Not a second wife… but I must become the second wife.)


The meeting with her mother, Saori, scheduled for July 20th. She might be able to convince Saori that she is Yuta's second wife, but a third or beyond would be impossible.  With Aoi as the first wife, Manami as the second, and Yukishiro as the third, neither Saori nor the Minato associates would agree.


(Manami-san understands that…)


Aoi and Manami accepted Yukishiro, quietly watching her relationship with Yuta develop. They anticipated the time when their relationship deepened.  While marriage doesn't always follow the order of engagements, the order is still significant.


(I need to take a step forward. To be seen by Yuta-sama… to be recognized as a woman who admires him.)


She squeezed the summer camellia handkerchief, her resolve firm.


(But how…)


Despite her resolve, she didn't know how.  After sitting opposite him, moving to sit beside him now seemed… strange.  The words of praise for Yuta felt embarrassing when she tried to speak them.


(Like before…)


The more she tried to act as she had before, the less she could.


(Ha… Why…?  Am I such a pathetic woman? I could do it.  Like acting… That's what it was… acting…)


Why couldn't she act as she had before?  She had been acting, praising men, flattering them, fawning over them.  That's why it was easy.


(It's not… acting. It's… my true feelings.)


Her love for Yuta. It wasn't acting; it was genuine.  She didn't know what to do with this true feeling.


(Thinking back… I never even held hands.)


From middle school, she had acted, praising and flattering Takuya, but she never touched him, never held his hand, she realized.


(How did Aoi-san become close to Yuta-sama?)


Yukishiro wouldn't dream of the way Aoi, on Yuta's second day back to school after a period of absence, suddenly decided to join him on a volunteer activity. To put it bluntly, it was utterly unconventional.


Furthermore, on their way back from the volunteer work, she sat close to him in his car, creating an intimate atmosphere and even leaning in to kiss him! only to be disappointed when they arrived at their destination. Yukishiro would have screamed, "How indecent!" if she knew.


Aoi's approach to Yuta was completely unhelpful to Yukishiro.


"I hope to interact with Akari and the others starting tomorrow."

"Thank you."


In her current state, she couldn't interact with the girls in the class like they did.  She knew she was the reason.  If she deepened her relationship with Yuta and became his second wife, Akari and the others could begin a true interaction with him.  Their current uncertain situation kept their interactions with Yuta hidden.


"We shouldn't stay out too late."

"Y-Yes. Thank you for this time with Yuta-sama."

"Come anytime; feel free to visit."


They both stood up.  Yuta seemed to escort her to the door.


(This… is it ending…)


Even walking slowly, she reached the door in an instant.  Once she put on her straw sandals, all she had to do was leave the room. Sadness crept into Yukishiro's smile.


"Yukishiro-san"

"!"


The moment she was about to put on her sandals, Yuta took her hand.


"During the trip, I'd like to… get to know Yukishiro-san better."

"Yuta-sama…"


He offered a lifeline to her pathetic self. Because she couldn't act, he took her hand. A woman who can't act when a man does this much is simply foolish.


(Not for someone else… for myself… I'll cherish my feelings… I've decided to be a little selfish!)


"Yuta-sama!"

"Y-Yes."


Yukishiro squeezed his hand back and buried her face in his chest.  She could feel his heartbeat.


"Please forgive this pathetic me for conveying my feelings."

"Yukishiro-san isn't pathetic. You're a wonderful woman."


She embraced him, her whole body pressed against his.  Her face was crimson, and she couldn't meet his eyes, but she had given everything she had.


"I admire you."


Tears welled up.  What right did a woman who served as Takuya's direct subordinate have to say this?  But her love was genuine.  Her true love was before her.


"Yukishiro-san"

"Y-Yes…"


Yuta gently embraced her.


"I'm happy. I'll work hard… to like Yukishiro-san, too… to really get to know you…"

"Yes… yes… thank you."


Their embrace continued silently until Yukishiro's tears subsided.



Waiting for Yukishiro's return were Aoi and Manami.  As soon as Yukishiro came back from Yuta's room, they pulled her into her room.  Seeing Yukishiro's expression, both of them looked delighted.


"How was it?!"


Unlike their previous subtle observation, this direct question surprised Yukishiro, but after a deep breath, she calmly replied.


"I told Yuta-sama my feelings. Thank you."


She bowed her head in gratitude to Aoi and Manami.  She had been able to convey her feelings to Yuta thanks entirely to them.


"Please raise your head. It's good that you were able to convey your feelings to Yuta-sama!"


They didn't ask what Yuta said.  They didn't need to ask; Yuta's feelings for Yukishiro were Yukishiro's to know.


"Starting tomorrow, I think we should prioritize Yuta-sama's interaction with you and Akari-san."

"W-What? Really?"

"Yes. How deeply your relationship with Yuta-sama develops before the 20th is important."

"Y-Yes, thank you so much."

"Yuta-sama's birthday is the 17th; we have an outing planned for the morning.  Yukishiro-san, please join us."

"Yes!"


Yukishiro answered cheerfully.  Manami then chimed in on the conversation between Aoi and Yukishiro.


"Yukishiro-sama, the person you have in mind as Yuta-sama's wife is Akari-san, correct?"


In this world, men can have multiple wives. However, it's usually a handful at most.  Wives have various rights over their husbands, so few men take many wives.


Aoi would become Yuta's first wife, and Yukishiro his second. If Manami then became his third wife… considering the power balance between Yoshiwara and Minato, having another wife from Minato would create balance.


Of course, it's ultimately Yuta's decision.  However, from the women's perspective, they need to discuss their ideal outcome.


"Yes. If Yuta-sama approves, I wish for Akari-san to be his wife."

"Understood."


If the women's desires were fulfilled, Yuta would have four wives. If Moe, whom Aoi and Manami wished for, also became his wife, he'd have five.  Besides those, he has over 50 potential lovers.


"First, we need to successfully conclude the meeting on the 20th, but assuming things go well, we must protect Yuta-sama thoroughly."

"Is something wrong?"


Yukishiro sensed something in Aoi's words.


"Other eternal families are investigating Yuta-sama."

"They've noticed Yuta-sama."

"Yes. They already know Yuta-sama is the succubus Yuu-sama. The problem is if it's known that he's the inventor of the succubus suit and other items."

"Even though the rights to the business were entrusted to Yoshiwara, they'll still attack."


Yukishiro hadn't yet been informed about the organization.  Therefore, Yuta's businesses, including the succubus suits, were under Yoshiwara's management.  And she still didn't know about his headaches.


"Minato will also be involved from now on."

"Are you sure?  It's not exactly a favorable situation for Minato…"

"If Yoshiwara and Minato can join forces to prevent interference from other eternal families, there couldn't be anything more reassuring."

"Against the government as well."

"Yes!"


Tokyo, the capital of Japan, has a larger population and stronger economy than other regions.  Two of the five eternal families, known as the Five Great Families, are located in Tokyo due to the population and economic strength.  If there was only one eternal family in Tokyo… that family would possess immense power. The rivalry between Yoshiwara and Minato in Tokyo maintains the balance with other eternal families.


(Yoshiwara and Minato joining forces, using succubus and angel suits as sex toys to control Japan's economy.  It's hardly a fairy tale; it's a realistic scenario. The government will certainly want to do something about it.)


As Yukishiro predicted, it's not an ideal situation for the government.


(To shoulder all this trouble…)


Aoi's acceptance of Yukishiro means taking on numerous problems.  Despite this, Aoi accepts Yukishiro.  The reason is simple.



"Let's support Yuta-sama together!"



Aoi's smiling hand taking Yukishiro's. This smile warmed Yukishiro's heart.


She couldn't support Takuya with Layla.  But she believed she could support Yuta with Aoi.


True love for Yuta, and trust for Aoi and the others.  Yukishiro would give them all her heart.
