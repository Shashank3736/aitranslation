Episode 5: Class Trip ⑤
July 16th.

Yuuta continues to interact with Minato's group, centered around Yukishiro and Akari.  Their bond deepened further after an intimate incident at the water park the previous day.  Akari, having finished her talk with Manami, joins them, and their enjoyable interactions continue.

Meanwhile, Aoi and Manami are welcoming guests to the inn: Nanase and her group.  Nanase, Takashi, and Mizuki have arrived, along with Takashi's lover, Sakurako, and her son, Naoto, to participate in Yuuta's birthday party tomorrow.

"It's been three years, hasn't it?"
"Yes. Everyone is delighted to have you, Nanase-sama."

Nanase, reunited with the landlady, an old acquaintance, seems happy.

"You cause so much trouble every year with Yuuta-sama's class trip."
"Not at all. Everyone is overjoyed."
"Hee hee. That's good to hear."

The landlady reviews the annual reports and discusses the inn's condition. This inn is the highest-class facility among Yoshiwara's summer resort properties, making it the perfect location for Yuuta's important class trip.

"Naoto-sama was four years old, wasn't he?"
"Yes. Children grow up so fast."
"Only two more years?"
"……Yes."

Boys leave to live apart from their mothers when they start elementary school.  While there are women and fully automated robots to care for them, ensuring no lack of support…

Sakurako, as Naoto's mother, only has two years left to shower him with her affection.

"Naoto-sama seems to have a good relationship with Takashi-sama."
"That's right. My husband is a truly wonderful person."
"Hee hee. The relationship between Nanase-sama and Takashi-sama is no less impressive than Aoi-sama and Yuuta-sama."
"Well, of course. I have no intention of losing to my daughter and her husband."

Their perfectly synchronized exchange makes them laugh, looking at each other's faces.

"The Angel Suit has been incredibly helpful in maintaining a good relationship with my husband."
"We hear you've been spending more passionate nights with Mizuki-sama and the three of you."
"That's true. The result of improving the texture to my husband's liking."
"Don't you use dildos?"
"I can't allow anything other than my own, even a dildo, to enter between us in front of me."

Takashi skillfully uses Angel Suits and dildos to maintain good relationships with his lovers. However, when it's the three of them—Nanase, Mizuki, and himself—he uses only himself, even while using the Angel Suit.  Men have various ways of thinking.

Takashi doesn't forbid Nanase and Mizuki from using dildos altogether. When they aren't with Takashi, both Nanase and Mizuki make ample use of them.

"The Takashi-sama exclusive VR game is also wonderfully made."
"Thanks to your provision of Yuuta-sama's game development data. At this age, to relive my husband and my middle and high school years… it’s bliss."

Using the development data from the "淫魔ユウ (Inma Yu)" VR game, a Takashi-exclusive VR game was created.  This game is not commercially available; only Takashi's wife and lovers can play it.

Yoshiwara and the government are considering expanding this type of wife-and-lovers-only game. Using the base data from the Inma Yu game, it's possible with a little cooperation from men—cooperation that's largely unconscious.  It's achieved through memory function, recording sexual acts and reflecting them in the game data.  For audio, if the woman wears an earring with a microphone function, it naturally records. Just as the Angel Suit’s use in high school class management has yielded good results, the plan is to use sex toys such as the Angel Suit to maintain good lover-husband relationships.

"You're enjoying your middle and high school life with Yuuta-sama, right?"
"It's not Yuuta-sama. It's Inma Yu-sama."
"Hee hee, that's right."

All the women working at this inn enjoy a sweet middle and high school life with Inma Yu.

"Yuuta-sama would accept, wouldn't he?"
"We understand."
"I'm sorry."
"What are you saying?  Our lives were originally meant to end without knowing men. Yuuta-sama gave us this opportunity to interact with him, and furthermore, as Inma Yu-sama, granted us happiness. What more could we ask for?"

Including the landlady, the women working at the inn are all second or third daughters of prestigious families.  For the continuation of a prestigious family, it's crucial for the eldest daughter to be a lover or wife to a man.  However, it's different for the second and third daughters.

Unless it's an extremely powerful family, second and third daughters usually work somewhere and spend their lives that way. If they have children through artificial insemination, they'll live as ordinary citizens.

In Japan, there's a limit to the number of children a woman can have; it's generally two. However, for a man's wife or lover, if the pregnancy is due to sexual intercourse with the man, the limit is three.

In either case, having one child is the most common, with two being the most children. Even if they have the right, having a third child is rare.

Having a second or third child is typically to wish for a son—a boy, who is born with a probability of only one in ten thousand.  The fact that wives and lovers can have a third child only if it results from sexual intercourse with a man is because there's a higher chance of having a son compared to artificial insemination.

Sex selection through artificial insemination is impossible, and attempts in the past had horrific results.

The conversation between Nanase and the landlady implies that they don't want the inn's staff to aspire to become Yuuta's lovers—with the exception of Tomoe, who is his shield, protecting him.  Yuuta doesn't harbor ill feelings towards Tomoe for her past mistakes, and instead seems to have positive feelings towards her, which is why he encouraged her.

It's practically impossible for older women to become lovers or wives. It's not uncommon for male middle school students to have relationships with their female supervisors—often initiated by the supervisor's seduction. Takuya is a prime example, having impregnated multiple supervisors. However, Takuya acted because the supervisors agreed to not become his lovers or wives.  The same applies in other cases; when males pursue supervisors, it's under the condition that the supervisor won't become their lover or wife.

The same applies to volunteer work.  The women requesting volunteer work from prestigious families are, like the women working at this inn, second or third daughters, or eldest daughters who have given up on continuing the family line. A prestigious family’s eldest daughter who already has a partner wouldn't request volunteer work.

In volunteer work, too, it's common practice for women to engage in transactions with men. In extreme cases, men desire high evaluations, and women pay for an A-rank evaluation, seeking sexual relations with men. Here, too, the condition is that the man doesn't take the woman as a lover or wife.

In the past, there was a woman who deceptively impregnated a relatively inexperienced male middle school student and pressured him into a relationship. That woman was prosecuted by the state as a criminal for deceiving the boy. The boy received a warning but otherwise returned to his normal middle school life.

Becoming a lover or wife grants rights over that man, especially for a wife.  The rights of the first wife are even greater.

Men, by granting rights to their wives, ensure their own life's protection.  Therefore, they naturally avoid older women, who have a higher risk of dying before them.  The national system encourages interaction with women of the same age.

If a man seeks a woman after gaining a wife who protects his life, that woman would be younger. Sakurako, who bore Takashi's son, is 10 years younger than him. However, most men are fully occupied with their wives and lovers of similar age and seldom pursue younger women.

The second and third daughters from prestigious families working at this inn fell for Yuuta during last year's class trip.  Their service to Yuuta, under the guise of massage, led them to choose him as the man they desired.  They've acquired all the sex toys released since then and are all enjoying the Inma Yu exclusive VR game.

And this year, Yuuta’s class trip is once again at this inn.  The extended range of the Angel Suit allows Yuuta and the girls to enjoy intimate moments, delighting the inn's women as well.

The idea of becoming Yuuta’s lover, the only man they desire, crosses their minds.  The landlady herself has considered it numerous times.

But it's not permitted. Even if Yuuta is the rare man who accepts older women. Currently, Yuuta is developing relationships not only with Aoi but also with Yukishiro.  Adding the girls who are subordinate to him, plus those from Minato's group who aren't yet subordinate, he already has over 50 potential lovers.  There’s no time for Yuuta to spend with the landlady and the others while he's with these younger girls.

"What about in five years?"
"Thank you for your consideration. But even in five years, it would be difficult. Realistically, ten years would be necessary."
"……I suppose."
"By ten years, I wouldn’t be of childbearing age."
"With current medical technology, the risks of geriatric pregnancy are low."
"Such wonderful opportunities should be given to younger girls."

After Yuuta's relationships with his lover candidates settle down, the landlady and others becoming his lovers might be considered. But it'll take at least ten years for that to happen.

"We hear that Inma Yu-sama's wonderful game will continue to be developed.  We have more than enough happiness.  Besides…"

The landlady reveals a seductive smile, unseen before.

"Since the day you arrived, Aoi-sama and Manami-sama have given us many opportunities to experience their passionate nights, too ♡"
"Hee hee, that’s wonderful."

The Angel Suits and dildos seem to be working exceptionally well.


"Mother!"

While Nanase and the landlady are talking, Aoi comes to see her mother.

"Yes, dear? What is it?"
"Father is patting Yuuta-sama's back hard again!"
"Hee hee, don't worry too much. It's male bonding."

Takashi is largely aware of Yuuta's situation. The only thing he doesn't know about is the "memory manipulation" explained by the organization.  He knows that Inma Yu = Yuuta and that Yuuta is the inventor of the succubus suit and dildos.  Since the Angel Suit is based on the succubus suit, Takashi is grateful to Yuuta for allowing him to spend passionate nights again with Nanase and Mizuki and for improving his relationships with his lovers.

To express this gratitude, the boisterous Takashi laughs and pats Yuuta's back hard.  Yuuta doesn’t object, and laughs joyfully with Takashi.

"I'll excuse myself now."
"Yes, see you later."

With Aoi's arrival, the landlady leaves the room. With only mother and daughter left, Nanase gently embraces Aoi.

"It's alright, dear. Yuuta-sama's headaches aren't physical."
"……Yes."
"It's okay. It's okay…"

Since Yuuta collapsed during last year's field trip, a constant anxiety resides in Aoi’s heart—an anxiety that remains unresolved.

Yuuta still gets headaches. Before the field trip, they didn't know about his headaches, so they missed his brief changes. Now, if Yuuta feels even a momentary headache, Aoi and the others notice immediately.

Every time Yuuta gets a headache, they fear he might collapse or even die.  The anxiety and worry are unbearable.

Since they haven't told Takashi about Yuuta's memory manipulation, they haven't told him about the headaches either. Aoi worries inwardly as Takashi, unaware, happily pats Yuuta’s back hard. She subtly asks Nanase to tell Takashi not to hit Yuuta's back, but Takashi laughs it off, saying it's male bonding.

"Are the preparations for Yuuta-sama's birthday party going smoothly?"
"Yes! Everything is perfect."
"Will Yukishiro-san be there in the morning?"
"Yes."
"Mother is happy that Aoi is getting along well with Yukishiro."

Nanase feels partly responsible for Yukishiro’s unfortunate circumstances, even though it’s not essentially true.

(But I'm sure I… and again, I try to save her.)

Mizuki, who once saved her, and Mizuki’s daughter Manami are trying to save Yukishiro. Although the circumstances are different, the desire to save someone is the same.

(Then I… what I must do…)

Nanase had been getting updates from Yukishiro on the situation in Minato’s group for her meeting with Saori.  One piece of information stood out.

(Saori-sama informed Yukishiro-san of the termination of her direct affiliation with Takuya-sama and her engagement to another man on the night of last year’s Christmas festival.  And Saori-sama went to the festival… Not only last year, but Saori-sama goes out of the mansion every year to attend the Christmas festival…)

This information from Yukishiro was a huge shock to Nanase because…

(But… I've never seen Saori-sama at the Christmas festival. I asked Mizuki-san about the years I couldn't attend, but she hasn't seen her either.)

Nanase and her group had never seen Saori at the Christmas festival.
