Episode 12: Administrator

August, a certain day.

A meeting between Japan and the Meer Kingdom was underway in a back conference room of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence.

Only select high-ranking officials, including the Prime Minister, participated from Japan, and similarly, only high-ranking royalty attended from the Meer Kingdom.

The meeting aimed to increase the Meer Kingdom's export of rare earth metals, essential to Japan.  These metals were crucial for mass production of succubus suits, and a considerable amount was also needed for a theme park Yoshiwara was constructing.

Thanks to Layla's efforts, they had successfully summoned very high-ranking royalty.  If they could finalize the negotiations, there was a high probability of immediate implementation.  However, the Meer Kingdom's demands were difficult.

“There’s nothing beyond the information we’ve provided. As I’ve said many times, the project has failed.”

“I see…”

A top-secret Japanese project.  What the Meer Kingdom wanted were its results.

“I hear that your Ms. Lira shares the same opinion.”

The Prime Minister looked at Lira, a hooded scientist participating as royalty.

“My findings are the same.”
“Can you not create men…?”
“Unfortunately not.”

The project aimed to create "men" by using the genetic information of men from the Old World to create a "soul" and a "body."  The Meer Kingdom had long suspected Japan of succeeding in creating men.  Seira's top-secret mission was also related to this.  Japan had consistently reported the project's failure, but the Meer Kingdom suspected they were concealing the results.

Japan often expressed disgust at the Meer Kingdom's governance system, describing it as "letting men run wild."  However, in a world with few men, it's impossible to simply let them run wild without any consideration.

Only royalty can meet these "freely roaming" men. The Meer Kingdom's royalty is similar to Japan's noble families, though far fewer in number.

Men in the Meer Kingdom live freely within the capital city. Only royalty can enter the capital.  Losing royal status means losing the right to meet men.

“Your genetic engineering technology… doesn't seem very advanced.”
“We prioritize safety.”
“Then isn't technological progress too slow?”
“Our current genetic engineering technology is sufficient to meet your needs.”

The small number of royals bear children through indiscriminate sexual acts with the freely roaming men.  Artificial insemination is used to produce children with "slaves," and any male children are immediately taken. The Meer Kingdom maintains its state in this way, with the "purity of blood" of the royal family constantly being an issue.

The Meer Kingdom receives sperm and artificial insemination technology from Japan, as well as genetic engineering technology.  This isn't solely from Japan; other countries possess advanced artificial insemination and genetic engineering technologies.  However, among these countries, Japan's technology boasts superior safety.  Therefore, higher-ranking royals tend to prefer Japan's genetically engineered children.

“We can provide experimental subjects, if you like?”
“We have enough.”

The Meer Kingdom wants Japan to establish even more advanced and safer genetic engineering technology and provide it. Since they failed to create men from Old World genetic information, they have no choice but to advance genetic engineering technology.

“It's possible to provide the amount of rare earth metals Japan desires. However, Her Majesty the Queen is not satisfied with the same compensation as before.”
“Considering the Meer Kingdom's situation, having the slaves bear many more male children from Japanese men’s sperm is quite important, wouldn’t you say?”
“It is important… However, the ‘selection and upbringing of men’ requires significant time and effort.”

While Japan calls the Meer Kingdom a place where men are allowed to run wild, what does the Meer Kingdom think of Japan? They believe they are "birds of a feather."  To the Meer Kingdom, Japan is no different from them; they simply have more detailed rules and laws, but they still 'select and raise men.'  The difference lies in whether they meticulously create a pathway for selection and growth or select men who have grown through the results of being let loose.  They believe the underlying action is the same.

“That's the natural hardship of those who stand above the people.”

The Prime Minister said with exasperation.  He understood from the royalty's words—which denied the selection and raising of men—that they wanted to improve genetic engineering technology to produce children from "conveniently raised men."

The Queen's intentions were also at play.  Perhaps the compatibility with a man she particularly liked wasn't good.  She had already undergone genetic modification 'several times' to bear children with several men she liked.  The fact that she still yearned for children with this man left the Prime Minister dumbfounded.  It was likely that the current genetic engineering technology couldn't improve compatibility with this man.  This wasn't a matter of blood purity.  While wanting to minimize risks when bearing children is understandable...

“We will continue our efforts. But striving for better is inevitable. Please push forward with Ms. Lilis’ research.”
“I will do my best.”

Lilis, who was sitting next to the Prime Minister wearing a hood, replied.

“Please tell Her Majesty the Queen that Lilis will examine her personally if necessary.”
“Understood. Let's export about half of the desired amount to Japan next month.  We will report the remaining half to Her Majesty and seek her judgment.”
“Understood.”

The Prime Minister decided this was a good compromise and changed the subject.

“It’s a shame that the Meer Kingdom doesn’t need succubus suits.”
“We have no use for such things in our country.”

Succubus suits and other sex toys were meaningless in negotiations with the Meer Kingdom. In the capital, royalty can pursue men whenever they please.  The capital's male-to-female ratio is said to be 1:1, with men everywhere.  There's no need for succubus suits.

What about the slaves?  It's dangerous for the slaves to "know" the happiness that can be obtained through succubus suits. Once they know, it's difficult to take it away.  Slaves must be made happy with what they are given.

“If we could create men, the slaves would be happy…”

The Prime Minister muttered inwardly, exasperated by the royalty's illogical thinking.

If Japan had succeeded in creating men, they would have released them into the capital, allowing the royalty to choose their favorites.  They even considered releasing men among the slaves.  The men would be assaulted by female slaves, leading to a life of sexual intercourse with women only, until their bodies and minds broke, ultimately leading to death.  Then, they would introduce new created men.  This would be the Meer Kingdom’s dream.

The Prime Minister felt anger at being considered "birds of a feather" by the Meer Kingdom's royalty.  They might live in the same hole, but they are definitely not the same kind of badger.


The meeting with the Meer Kingdom ended, leaving only the Prime Minister and Lilis in the conference room.

“Hey, are the Meer Kingdom's royalty and I really the same kind of people?”

Perhaps because they were alone, the Prime Minister spoke to Lilis in a more casual tone.

“What defines a human?”
“Well… how about a life form created by God?”
“Kukuku.  That would make me a human too, wouldn’t it?”
“Oh, I suppose so.”

The Prime Minister shrugged, raising both hands.

“As an administrator, I can understand the Meer Kingdom's thinking, but I don't find it rational.”
“Administrators are chosen to determine what is rational.”
“When will we get the answer?”
“Who knows?  Whether God will give us an answer or not…”

Several new emails had arrived on the Prime Minister's tablet, one from the Deputy Prime Minister.

“Your created, failed god doesn’t seem to be waking up?”
“I told you. He was never going to be a god from the start.”
“Because of him, we’re having a hard time. We’re desperately trying to cope with the changes he caused.”
“It’s not something to be happy about. The most unforgivable thing in this world is not changing. Change should be welcomed.”

The Prime Minister manipulated the tablet, selecting the ‘Administrator Candidates’ section.  The tablet displayed a ‘ranking’ of women.

“I want to deal with the changes he caused during my time, so as not to inconvenience the next administrators.”
“Kukuku. You're a truly excellent administrator, accepting his actions.”

The Prime Minister answered without changing his expression.

“It’s only natural. That is the ‘management’ entrusted to Japan.”
“As I said before, it’s not something God gave us. It’s simply the ‘current answer’ derived from Japan’s history.”
“I understand.  For me, what our ancestors built is the same as what God gave us. And I too will entrust something to the next generation.”

Lilis had interacted with many administrators, but this was the first time she could talk so freely with one. That’s why, while she was an administrator, she tried to create a soul and a body from the genetic information of men from the Old World.

“If only I could have created the body…”
“It can’t be helped. You weren't created that way.”

Lilis could create souls but not bodies. Creating bodies had to be left to Japan's scientists. As a result, the created bodies weren't suitable for receiving souls.

“Perhaps it’s precisely because you can't create bodies that men like him who are compatible exist?”
“Maybe so…”

Lilis slowly stood up and looked kindly at the Prime Minister.

“I’m going to check on the prince who won’t wake up.”
“We could leave him asleep for two or three years?”
“Kukuku. That would be cruel. I'm the one who fused him.”

Lilis intends to carefully examine Yuuta.  The outcome is uncertain.

“The fusion was successful, right?”
“Absolutely. He is neither an Old World man nor a man from before. He’s a uniquely suitable being, the result of the fusion.”
“But he says he’s an Old World man.”
“Something makes him think that… or maybe he wants to think that? I don’t know. Let’s see when I meet him.”
“Please do. The women surrounding the prince seem to be in an uproar.”

Lilis started walking toward the door, but stopped after a few steps.

“Oh, by the way,”
“Yes?”
“What about the woman who was manipulating Minato?”
“Ah.”

The Prime Minister said it casually, like talking about tomorrow's weather.

“We’ll dispose of her.”
“Right.”
“As for Saori… we utilized her because the result of her natural course of events was like that, but manipulating her daughter to follow the same path was a disqualification as an administrator.”
“In the end, her daughter is walking a happy path. Human destiny is truly unpredictable.”
“Pfft.”

The Prime Minister burst out laughing.

“What?”
“Sorry.  I didn’t expect to hear the word destiny from you.”
“I’m surprisingly romantic?”
“I know. But, pfft.”

Lilis gave the Prime Minister a reproachful look, as if to say it was offensive, and quietly left the room.


The Prime Minister, left alone, looked through the emails on his tablet.  Among them was a report from Takuya.

(No change in direction… It looks like he’ll be working hard in a small world.)

Sent to a small world.  Some women from the noble families who know about this believe it’s punishment for men.  That’s a correct understanding.  Men also face many hardships in a small world, different from their previous world. But it’s not the punishment the noble women believe it to be.

(This world doesn't have that kind of leisure.)

How effectively can they utilize the scarce resource of men?  Humanity has no margin for maintaining its civilization while continuing to survive.

(The most unforgivable thing is not changing…)

Men who only receive low rankings are those who dislike change.  The most troublesome individuals are those who do nothing and desire to enjoy the same routine.  There was a time when they tried to force such men to become active, using various methods.  However, all of these efforts ultimately failed.

While considering how to utilize them effectively, the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned the case of a serial rapist.  It aligned with the Prime Minister's intentions and had yielded some results.

Takuya is different from men who dislike change.  Even if Takuya's actions deeply hurt some women, it’s a minor matter from the administrator's perspective.  For the administrator, the problem isn’t Takuya’s actions, but the fact that he doesn't fit within the rules laid out in the large world of Japan.  They just need to prepare a world suitable for Takuya.  Starting with a small world.  If this proves acceptable to many women, the world will gradually expand. However, it’s doubtful that Takuya's world will be accepted by many women.

(Men who disliked change are now bringing about great change.)

Whether he wakes up or not is uncertain.  But if he does, they’ll have to deal with the changes he causes.  The Prime Minister won’t restrict his actions, as long as the women of the world accept change.

That is the mission entrusted to the Prime Minister as an “administrator.”
