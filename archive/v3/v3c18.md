Episode 18: The Sleeping Prince (Part 7)

Aoi and her companions were told by Lilith that if they went to the research institute at 8 PM, they could observe Yuuta's reaction to sexual activity.

Aoi, Yukishiro, and Manami proceeded to caress Yuuta's body, meticulously licking the areas Lilith had indicated.  After stimulating him to erection, Aoi had intercourse with him, carefully avoiding any strain on his body.

Unexpectedly, two people entered the laboratory: Rira, a high-ranking member of the Meiru royal family, and, surprisingly, Leila.  Tomoe and Ayaka, who had been watching over Aoi and the others, kept Leila near the entrance.


The next day, after encountering Leila, Aoi and the others felt increased anxiety. They hadn't expected Leila to be the caretaker for Rira, the scientist Lilith had mentioned as an acquaintance.


Lilith had called taking Yuuta to the Meiru Kingdom a last resort. Aoi and the others hadn't decided to take him there, although they had considered letting him meet Suzune.  Allowing Yuuta and Leila to meet without their supervision was unacceptable.


(Leila knew that Yuuta was asleep in Liliths' research lab.)


After hearing the details of her conversation with Leila from Tomoe, Aoi pondered:


(And through Lady Rira, I was about to become the subject for the examination of Yuuta's sexual response?)


The most shocking revelation for Aoi and her companions was Leila's interest in Yuuta—an interest bordering on affection.  Why would Leila, Takuya's direct subordinate, have such feelings for Yuuta, having only met him once at last year's night party?


(Could this imagined scenario be reality?  Has Leila's target shifted from Takuya to Yuuta…?)


If that were the case, taking Yuuta to the Meiru Kingdom was unacceptable.  As a worst-case scenario, if they absolutely had to take him there, they would have to detain Leila and confine her somewhere to ensure safety.  However, confining Leila, a member of the Meiru royal family, even a low-ranking one, would cause an international incident.  While the Queen's approval would change things, bringing such a matter to her attention would be difficult. Explaining Yuuta's situation would also be a problem.


"I received permission to watch over the entrance to Liliths' laboratory every night to prevent Leila from entering," Ayaka reported.

"Thank you," Aoi replied.


Aoi and her companions were relieved. Rira would be present for Yuuta's examination at night. Aoi protested to Liliths' about allowing Rira to observe without permission, even if she was a high-ranking member of the Meiru royal family and a colleague. Liliths' responded that Rira's presence was necessary for the examination and that the examination methods were Aoi's responsibility.


They had been summoned last night to observe Yuuta's reaction to sexual activity, but not tonight.  Since Rira would visit the laboratory at night for the examination, Leila would likely come as well.  To prevent Leila from entering, Aoi had obtained permission from Liliths', through Ayaka, to watch and stop Leila at the door, but not enter the room herself.


"The boss contacted me; she's almost finished the groundwork to bring Suzune.  Everything should be ready by tomorrow morning, allowing us to meet with Suzune in the afternoon."


Tomoe and Ayaka were responsible for bringing Suzune.  If Yuuta didn't awaken during tonight and tomorrow's examinations by Liliths', they would have to meet Suzune. It was better to act quickly.


"Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san, could you arrange a meeting with Suzune tomorrow afternoon? If Yuuta hasn't woken up by tomorrow…we'll aim to meet Suzune as soon as possible," Aoi requested.

"Understood."


Tomoe and Ayaka would meet with Suzune.  And Yukishiro…?


"Are you sure you'll be alright? We can ask Saori to reschedule," Aoi asked, concerned.

"No…it's better to have the meeting sooner rather than later. It's important for me to be able to witness the meeting between Suzune and Yuuta without any reservations."


Nanase unexpectedly arrived at the hotel where Aoi and the others were staying. While finalizing details for a joint project with Minato and coordinating a meeting with Saori, Saori contacted Nanase directly.  The heads of the prominent families supporting Minato wished to speak with Yukishiro. They wanted to hold the meeting at Minato's mansion tomorrow, with Saori herself requesting a private meeting with Yukishiro. Yukishiro would spend the night in her room at Minato's mansion for this.


Returning Yukishiro alone to Minato's mansion was dangerous. Nanase offered to send bodyguards from Yoshiwara, but Yukishiro refused; the presence of Yoshiwara's bodyguards might offend the heads of the prominent families. Nanase had also promised to pick Yukishiro up from Minato's mansion after the meeting.


"Mother isn't foolish enough to easily break a promise between the heads of the Nagayo families," Yukishiro stated confidently.


Ririka was also at Minato's mansion. Yukishiro decided to go alone.


"I'm sorry I can't stay with Yuuta-sama tonight," Yukishiro apologized.

"We'll take good care of Yuuta-sama.  Yukishiro-san, please do your best with your meeting with Minato-san and the others," Aoi reassured her.


Yukishiro embraced Aoi tightly. While Aoi was usually more physically affectionate, the situation with Yuuta prevented it.  The lack of it felt somewhat lonely.


"There will be support tonight. Please don't worry," Manami added.

"Thank you. Please take care of Yuuta-sama," Yukishiro said to Aoi and Manami.


Manami also hugged Yukishiro, offering mutual support.  Their bond had strengthened since Yuuta's collapse, mirroring Aoi's closeness to Yukishiro.


"Aoi-san, take good care of Yuuta-sama," Nanase encouraged.

"Yes!"


Tomoe and Ayaka would not participate in watching over Yuuta tonight. Aoi had instructed them to focus on bringing Suzune.


Meeting Suzune didn’t guarantee she would agree to see Yuuta.  They didn’t want to force Suzune, a convict, into a meeting with him. Ideally, Suzune would choose to see him of her own free will. They had information that in Kanagawa prison, Suzune was repentant and spending her days in quiet atonement.  Meeting Yuuta with a spirit of atonement would be best.



Yukishiro returned to the Yoshiwara mansion with Nanase to prepare for the meeting.  During the drive, Nanase revealed something important.


"Yukishiro-san," Nanase began.

"Yes?" Yukishiro responded.

"There's something I've been wondering about since you told me about it before," Nanase continued.

"What is it?"

"Saori-sama attended the Holy Night Festival every year, didn't she?"

"Yes, she did."


Nanase paused, then said calmly,


"Saori-sama hasn't attended the Holy Night Festival."

"What?" Yukishiro was taken aback.

"I've never seen Saori-sama at the Holy Night Festival.  Mizuki-san attended when I couldn't, but she hasn't seen Saori-sama either. I've confirmed through contacts that Saori-sama wasn't present."


Every year, Yukishiro had seen her mother, Saori, leave to attend the Holy Night Festival.  Although she couldn't see her off last year, she had in previous years.


"How often did you see your father, Yukishiro-san?"

"My father… I don't have any memories of him.  I've heard that I met him when I was a baby."

"Your father spends his time at the summer villa, not at Minato's mansion, correct?"

"Yes, that's what I've heard."


In this world, this wasn't uncommon.  Yukishiro's father had Saori as his first wife, but he undoubtedly had other wives and lovers. It wasn't unheard of for a father to never see the child he fathered.  Someone like Takashi, involved in raising his children, was unusual.


"Have you ever heard anything from Saori-sama about your father?"

"Yes, she says he's a kind father who is happy about my growth, even though he can't meet me."

"Have you heard anything about her relationship with your father?"

"My mother's relationship with my father…? I've never heard anything directly from Mother.  Ena-san told me it was normal; neither good nor bad."

"I see… Did Ena-san say anything about the Holy Night Festival?"

"Before she fell ill, Ena-san also went to the Holy Night Festival with Mother. She never mentioned anything to me."


Nanase had never seen Saori or Ena at the Holy Night Festival.  Nanase knew Ena's face, so there was no mistake.


(What's going on?)


Yukishiro was equally perplexed.  Ena, before she fell ill, had revealed that Saori's heart was broken because of Saori's mother, the previous head of the family.


(Ena-san never said anything about my father.)


A father she never saw.  This was common in their world, and Yukishiro hadn't given it much thought.


(Not attending the Holy Night Festival.  To attend, she should be with my father.  If my father refused to attend, she wouldn't have to attend either.)


But Saori and her husband were portrayed in a love story fabricated by the previous head of the family; a great love story that rivaled even Nanase's own.  Although no one believed it.


(Still, they wouldn't break that pretense at the Holy Night Festival…? No, that's also strange. She didn't attend at all. Why did she tell me she was going to attend?)


Since they went together, Ena must have known the truth. There must have been something she couldn't tell Yukishiro.


(Did she not want to break the pretense for my sake…?  She wanted me and Iori to think she and Father were attending the Holy Night Festival…? Does Ririka-san know anything…?)


As young children and teenagers, Yukishiro and Iori seldom heard gossip about the adult social world; and still don't, even now as high school students.


"In previous meetings, I couldn't reach Saori-sama's heart. When Yukishiro-san came to me for help, I thought I could reach her heart. But I was wrong.  I…we have misunderstood something," Nanase said.

"Misunderstood…"


Without answers, the car arrived at the Yoshiwara mansion. Yukishiro immediately began to prepare.  She bathed, had her makeup done, and put on a kimono, transforming herself into the image of the future head of the Minato family.


Back in the car with Nanase, they headed towards Minato's mansion.  As they got out of the car, Nanase took Yukishiro's hand.


"The only person who can reach Saori-sama's heart is her daughter, Yukishiro-san," Nanase said.

"Me…?" Yukishiro asked, surprised.

"Like how you strongly desire a connection with Yuuta-sama, strongly desire your connection with your mother, Saori-sama.  You are mother and daughter. An unbreakable bond. No matter what happens," Nanase affirmed.

"……Yes! I…I am my mother's daughter!"


Yukishiro and Nanase walked through the gates of Minato's mansion.
