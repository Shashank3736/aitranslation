Episode 24: The Sleeping Prince ⑨

Yukishiro, picked up by Nanase from Minato's mansion, travels by car to the hotel where Aoi and the others are staying.  En route, she informs Nanase that Minato's problem has been resolved—Yukishiro has been accepted as Yuuta's second wife.

“That’s wonderful.  For both Yukishiro-san and Aoi-san.  It’s excellent that Yoshiwara and Minato can build a cooperative relationship.”

“Yes.”

Yukishiro doesn’t mention anything about Saori, or her plan to immediately initiate a succession change upon marrying Yuuta.  It’s an internal Minato matter. She shouldn't continue relying on Nanase.  Nanase, in turn, doesn't inquire about the state of Yukishiro and Saori's relationship.

“With Yuuta-sama’s problem solved, Yukishiro-san will be returning to Minato, won’t you?”

“Yes, that’s my intention.  Thank you so much for everything.”

“We’ll leave your room as it is. Come visit anytime.”

“Yes!  I want to create a place in Minato… where Aoi-san can visit anytime.”

“Heehee. Aoi-san would be delighted to hear that.”

Yukishiro wants to share her joy with everyone. However, Yuuta, the center of it all, remains unconscious.

“Suzune-san is heading to the hotel now.”

“Is that so…”

“She’ll arrive before us.”

“Yes.”

As Nanase predicted, upon their arrival, Suzune is already being escorted into the hotel by Tomoe and the others.  After hearing the situation from those who picked them up, Nanase and Yukishiro head to the room where Aoi is waiting.

“Mother, Yukishiro-san…”

Aoi's face clearly shows distress as she greets them.  She wasn't able to sit calmly; she was standing just inside the doorway.

“We’re back, Aoi-san… It’s alright.”

Nanase immediately understands her daughter’s state and hugs Aoi tightly to calm her. In her mother's arms, Aoi gradually composes herself.

“Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san brought Suzune-san about ten minutes ago. She’s in a separate room now.”

Manami reports to Nanase.

“Let’s tell everyone about Yukishiro-san’s situation before meeting Suzune-san.”

“Yes.”

Yukishiro relays the resolution of the Minato issue and expresses her gratitude once more.  Yukishiro’s good news eases the strained atmosphere in the room created by Suzune’s arrival.  Aoi manages a smile.

“Yukishiro-san, congratulations.  That’s truly wonderful.”

“It’s all thanks to you all.”

Aoi and Yukishiro embrace, sharing their joy.  Usually, Aoi would be more physically affectionate, but this time it's different.  Instead, Yukishiro hugs Aoi tightly.

“Aoi-san, you’re afraid of meeting Suzune-san, aren’t you?”

“…Yes.”

“I’m scared too.  Meeting the woman who harmed Yuuta-sama… But for Yuuta-sama, let’s do our best.”

“…Yes.”

They suspect Suzune’s involvement in the reason for Yuuta’s unconsciousness.  The hope is that seeing Suzune might trigger some reaction in Yuuta. It’s a desperate measure, but it's their only option. Failure means resorting to the least desirable option: taking Yuuta to the Mir Kingdom.

“How is Suzune-san?”

Nanase asks Manami.

“She seems quite distressed, unable to grasp the situation.”

“You haven’t told her yet that Yuuta-sama is unconscious, have you?”

“No.”

“What about from Riris-san?”

“Let’s have them meet tonight.”

“I see…”

It’s almost 7 PM.  In an hour, they can take Suzune to Riris’s research facility.  Meeting Yuuta so soon might be too sudden for Suzune, but there’s no reason to delay.  Whether they meet now or tomorrow, the outcome of Suzune meeting Yuuta will be the same.

“You were planning to see Suzune-san before letting her meet Yuuta-sama, weren’t you?”

Nanase asks Aoi, who’s still in Yukishiro’s embrace.

“…Yes.”

“There’s no need to force a meeting.  Whether Aoi-san talks to her or not, it won't change whether Suzune meets Yuuta-sama.”

“…But…”

“Suzune-san is quite distressed. If Aoi-san confronts her now… it might close Suzune-san’s heart off.”

Nanase gently strokes the heads of the embracing Aoi and Yukishiro.

“I’ll speak to Suzune-san. Tomoe-san, Ayaka-san, and I will take Suzune-san there, so Aoi-san and the others should go to the research facility first.”

Riris has already given permission for Aoi and the others to be present when Suzune meets Yuuta. Aoi nods at Nanase's words.

“Then, later. Let’s meet at the research facility.”

After leaving the room, Nanase heads towards Suzune’s room.  Aoi, Yukishiro, Manami, and Moe, after a brief discussion, head to Riris's research facility.


Two prison guards from Kanagawa Penitentiary stand outside Suzune’s room. The penitentiary was suddenly ordered from above to release a lifer.  Suzune’s escape would be a major problem, so the guards are there as escorts.


“I am Nanase, head of the Yoshiwara family. May I enter?”

“Please wait.”

Recognizing Nanase, the guard informs Tomoe and the others inside, then opens the door.  Inside, Tomoe stands against the wall, Ayaka rises from her chair, and Suzune, sitting, is clearly confused.  Seeing Nanase, she becomes even more bewildered and shocked.

Suzune had been devouring romance novels featuring Nanase.  Her idol is now before her. But she is a criminal who sexually assaulted Yuuta, Aoi’s fiancé.  Suzune is utterly lost.

Nanase, observing Suzune, doesn't see someone capable of committing a sexual crime. She seems gentle and kind, just as others described her before the crime.  With a calm and collected voice, Nanase speaks to the distressed Suzune.

“Nice to meet you, Suzune-san. I am Nanase, head of the Yoshiwara Eternal Family.”

“Y-yes!  Ah… nice to meet you… Suzune.”

“I’m sure you’re surprised by this sudden event.”

“…Yes.”

“As head of the Yoshiwara Eternal Family, I promise you that no harm will come to you.  No matter what.”

“I… I’m a criminal, so…”

“Nihon is a country ruled by law. Suzune-san has served her sentence in prison.  You don’t need to demean yourself to us.”

Only Yuuta has the right to condemn Suzune.  Nanase believes this. While Suzune's crime is unforgivable as a human being, she shouldn’t unleash her anger arbitrarily.

“In a little while, we’d like you to move to another location. Yuuta-sama is there.”

“Ah… will I really meet Yuuta-sama?  I thought he wouldn’t want to…”

Suzune is baffled as to why she's meeting Yuuta. Nanase explains.

“Yuuta-sama is currently unconscious, in a deep sleep.”

“…What?”

“He’s physically healthy, but unconscious. We don’t know the cause.”

“S-so…”

“Yuuta-sama… sometimes suffered from headaches.”

“Headaches?”

“Yes.  As far as we know, this is only the second time Yuuta-sama lost consciousness due to a headache. The first time was last October, during a class field trip… when the incident involving Suzune-san was discussed.”

“What…?”

“Tomoe-san here mentioned the incident in front of Yuuta-sama.  The reason she brought it up is that my daughter Aoi and Manami heard about it.”

Tomoe’s mistake. Tomoe bites her lip, regretting her error.

“He only lost consciousness temporarily then. He regained consciousness before the doctor arrived.”

“…”

“And then, this time. From July, Yuuta-sama was enjoying a class trip. But at the end of July, during the fireworks display, he became unwell, lost consciousness, and hasn't woken up since.”

“S-so at that fireworks display too?”

“No. Suzune-san’s incident wasn't discussed then.  We thought the headaches were caused by the painful memories of the incident.  We don’t know why he collapsed during the fireworks, or why he remains unconscious.”

“So… me?”

“The doctor currently examining Yuuta-sama suggested that seeing Suzune-san might trigger a reaction. The incident involving Suzune-san is undoubtedly one of the causes of his headaches.”

“That… that’s…”

“It’s a desperate measure. But we thought it better than simply waiting and hoping he’ll wake up. We decided to have you meet him.  This is sudden for you, but please, for Yuuta-sama, will you meet him and speak to him?”

“Speak… my voice…”

“Yes.  Yuuta-sama’s unconscious mind might react to your voice.  He may not react at all. Of course, whatever happens, you bear no responsibility. We’re asking this of you.”


After Nanase finishes, Suzune finally understands the situation. Why she was brought here. Why they want her to meet Yuuta.

“Yuuta-sama is unconscious… he's been asleep all this time…”

Because of her foolish and ugly actions, Yuuta is suffering. She learned of his engagement to Aoi from letters from her mother and Nagisa, and believed he was healing and enjoying a happy life.

But now, Yuuta is unconscious.  If there’s even a chance that seeing her will help Yuuta regain consciousness, Suzune doesn’t hesitate.

“Understood. I will… meet Yuuta-sama.”

“…Thank you.  In about 30 minutes, we'll leave for where Yuuta-sama is.”

“Yes…. Ah, could you tell me about the fireworks display when Yuuta-sama collapsed?”


Tomoe will explain.  Until they leave, Tomoe describes the events of that night to Suzune.
