Episode 6: Class Trip ⑥
July 17th.

It's Yuta's birthday.

They've returned to the garden Yuta, Aoi, and Manami visited last year.

This year, Aoi is there as Yuta's fiancée, Manami as his lover, and Yukishiro, having been relieved of her maid uniform (by Aoi, with plenty of physical affection), is also present in a beautiful dress.


Each woman's dress is designed after a flower:

Aoi wears a pure white dress representing the white lily.
Manami wears a purple and blue dress representing veronica.
Yukishiro wears a white and pink dress representing the marguerite.

All the dresses are of the highest quality.

Yuta gifted Aoi and Manami's dresses.  While the source of Yukishiro's dress isn't revealed, it was also Yuta who prepared it.  Though Yuta asked Aoi to keep it a secret from Yukishiro, Aoi's behavior made it obvious to Yukishiro.


Because Yuta gave Aoi a white lily fan, many lilies—white, orange, pink, and yellow—now bloom in the Yoshiwara garden.  They avoid planting lilies with inauspicious meanings.


Due to the veronica fan Yuta gave Manami, many veronica plants are also growing.  Since marguerites are out of season, Yuta gave Yukishiro a summer camellia handkerchief, leading to the planting of summer camellias in the garden.


Yuta walks with Aoi on his left and Yukishiro on his right, with Manami directly behind Aoi.


"I'm so happy to be walking in this garden with you again, Yuta-sama, just like last year."
"Me too.  I hope we can walk through this garden together for many years to come."


Yuta and Aoi's relationship continues to deepen.  Aoi is now able to talk to Yuta about the organization's affairs.  While the matter of the personality transplant from the man of the Old World is kept secret, Yuta believes he will never have to reveal it.  He is himself.  He is not someone else, neither the man from the Old World nor Yuta-kun.  Both sets of memories are his own.


"Last year, I asked Yuta-sama about your future aspirations."
"Yes, you did."
"Last year, your answer was vague.  What are your thoughts now?"


After a brief pause, Yuta replies to Aoi's question:


"To put it simply, it's still vague, but I want to do my best at everything in front of me."
"The things in front of you?"
"Yes.  Long-term goals are important, but right now, I'm doing my best with what's immediately before me. So, rather than worrying about the distant future, I want to focus on what's present and do my best."


Overwhelmed with joy, Aoi hugs Yuta.  Doing his best in the present—that includes Aoi, Manami, and Yukishiro... and everyone else, of course.


After his conversation with Aoi, Yuta glances to his right, understanding that it’s the wish of the person behind Aoi to be noticed.


"I'm also very happy to be walking with Yukishiro-san."
"Me too..."


Yukishiro echoes Aoi's radiant smile.


"I am also happy to be with Yuta-sama."


Even if people call her shameless or point fingers at her audacity, she won't look back.  Because Yuta, Aoi, and especially Manami are kind to her.  Unlike Aoi's more forceful approach, Yukishiro gently places her hand on Yuta's right arm, pressing close to him.


"Manami-san, thank you always."
"It makes me happy to be of service to Yuta-sama."


Manami watches the three of them with happiness.


If Aoi and Yuta's relationship continues to progress smoothly, their wedding will be next year on this day.  Like engagements, marriage proposals are typically made by the man, and the decision-making power rests with him.


Unlike engagements, which often take place on the woman's birthday, weddings based on proposals often occur on the man's birthday. This stems from the fact that men are legally allowed to marry from their 18th birthday, while women can marry at 17.


Few couples get married on the man's 18th birthday.  Nanase married Takashi on his 18th birthday.  Mizuki strongly desired to marry him on the same day, but she didn't agree, and their wedding took place on Takashi's 19th birthday.


Assuming Yuta's wedding is on his 18th birthday, if his partners were Aoi and Manami, Manami might have waited a year, like her mother.  However, Yukishiro is now involved.  Considering marriage with Yukishiro, who isn't even his lover yet, is premature, but it's important to consider.


If Aoi wants to marry Yuta alone, Yukishiro would have to withdraw. That would be the normal course of action.  For Yoshiwara, it's non-negotiable that Aoi be Yuta's first wife.


Taking Yukishiro as a second wife would mean that she'd likely return to Minato and become the head of the Minato perpetual family.  While Yoshiwara doesn't need to worry about Minato's honor, Aoi is considerate of Yukishiro.  And Yuta isn't foolish; he understands the situation of the perpetual family.  If Yuta marries Aoi and Yukishiro simultaneously on his 18th birthday next year, it would save face for Minato.


"Yuta-sama ♡"
"Yes?"
"May I give you your birthday present, just like last year?"
"Of course."


Aoi signals with her eyes, and the Yoshiwara women immediately appear.


"This is my birthday present for you. A ruby ring, your birthstone."
"Thank you! I'm so happy!"


From Aoi, his fiancée, comes a ruby ring with the ruby set within the ring for everyday wear, flanked by diamonds on either side, mirroring the emerald ring Yuta gave her as a symbol of their engagement. Yuta immediately puts it on his left ring finger.


"It fits perfectly. I'll wear it always."
"Hee hee, I'm glad."


Aoi's left ring finger also shines with the emerald ring Yuta gave her.  Matching rings make Aoi happy.


"Yuta-sama,"


Yukishiro speaks next.


"May I also give you a birthday present, Yuta-sama?"
"Yes, I'd be happy."


Yukishiro presents a handkerchief to Yuta.


"It's a handkerchief embroidered with morning glory, your birth flower.  I hope you like it."
"Thank you.  You embroidered this yourself, Yukishiro-san? It's beautiful!"


A pink morning glory is beautifully embroidered on the white handkerchief, matching Yukishiro's dress.  The marguerite's flower language is "secret love." White marguerites symbolize "trust," and pink ones symbolize "true love."  Thinking Yuta chose the colors of her dress to reflect these meanings, Yukishiro's heart fills with warmth and joy.


Yukishiro embroidered the morning glory, which symbolizes "bonds," wishing for a stronger bond with Yuta.


As a side note, morning glories are also known for their high reproductive capacity.  Yukishiro has no ulterior motives.


Next is Manami's turn.  Approaching Yuta calmly, she presents him with a short sword.


"Yuta-sama, this is my birthday present. Please accept this short sword."
"Thank you. I'm happy."


Like Aoi last year, Manami gives Yuta a short sword.  The scabbard is decorated with a plantain lily pattern, another of Yuta's birth flowers, along with the morning glory.


"And here's this."
"Yes?"


Following the short sword, Manami gives Yuta two boxes.  Not only Yukishiro, but Aoi also stares blankly.  Manami's actions were unscripted.


"Aoi-san, Yukishiro-san,"
"Yes!"
"Yes."
"Actually, I have presents for the two of you."


Yuta hands the boxes he received from Manami to Aoi and Yukishiro.  The shape and size of the boxes suggest their contents.


"Open them."


With trembling hands, Yukishiro opens her box to reveal a fan.


"Wow! Thank you!"


Aoi jumps for joy.  Next to her, Yukishiro fights back tears.  She hadn't expected to receive a fan.


"It's a matching fan with Manami-san's."
"I asked Yuta-sama if we could have matching fans, the three of us—Aoi-sama, Yukishiro-sama, and I."
"Th-thank… you."


Aoi gently hugs Yukishiro, who is desperately trying to hold back her tears.


"Yuta-sama, Manami-san, thank you. But, doesn't Manami-san not get a gift?"
"That's not a problem."
"Huh?"


Manami smiles slyly.


"I will be able to ask Yuta-sama for another favor."
"Oh ♡"
"Ahem.  We'll talk about that later."
"Yes.  When we return to the Yoshiwara mansion…"


Manami's eyes gleam, at least to Yuta.


"...people"
"Huh?"
"Now, let's explore over there."


Manami whispers something barely audible before returning to her position behind Aoi.  They continued their stroll.  They plan to have lunch at the garden restaurant before returning to the inn.


(Will Akari join them here?)


Many men in Japan are said to have only a few wives, usually no more than five.  While there's no official limit, it's practically difficult to have more than five.


(Takashi-san also has two, right?)


Even Takashi, who has many lovers, has only two wives: Nanase and Mizuki.  There's a significant difference between wives and lovers.  Wives have certain rights regarding their husbands, and lovers who bear children are allowed to use the family name, but to maintain a family name through generations, one must be a wife.


(My case is a bit special. I see, a harem is difficult, huh.)


Having both the next head of the Yoshiwara perpetual family and the next head of the Minato perpetual family as partners is unprecedented in Japan.  Even without this unique situation, the challenges of having multiple wives are apparent.


(I'm grateful to Aoi-san, of course, but I especially feel Manami-san's kindness. Takashi-san also said it—that Mizuki-san is the most superior.)


Aoi's feelings are crucial to accepting Yukishiro.  Aoi seems happy that she and Yukishiro get along well, even displaying physical affection with Yukishiro in front of Yuta.  Yukishiro seems to have mixed feelings about Aoi's physical affection.


Then there's Manami.  Normally, she'd be upset or demand something in return for prioritizing Yukishiro.  However, Manami doesn't.  She gives up the place she could have had to Yukishiro without asking for anything.


(Is she highly selfless? Excessive selflessness worries me. I have to make sure she's not overdoing it; I need to support her.)


Yuta's kindness toward Manami is his greatest happiness.


(By the time Akari joins, if things go well, Yukishiro-san will have returned to Minato.  Then, the way they interact will change, but…)


Currently, Yukishiro is staying in Yoshiwara, allowing Aoi and Yukishiro to interact in the same place.  But once Yukishiro returns to Minato, Yuta will likely visit Yoshiwara to be with Aoi and Minato to be with Yukishiro.


"I'm looking forward to the evening party!"
"We have little guests this year."
"Naoto-kun is so cute~"
"We're so happy to celebrate Yuta-sama's birthday together."


Yuta doesn't realize that a normal man wouldn't have such complicated relationships with women.  The fact that Aoi, Manami, Yukishiro, and everyone else involved have such unusual viewpoints is because Yuta accepts them.


From the women's perspective, Yuta is the most selfless man of all.


The four of them enjoyed a delightful lunch and continued their date until the end.
