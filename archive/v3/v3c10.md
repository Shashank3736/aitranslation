Episode 10: Class Trip ⑨

Yuta and the others returned to the inn after their meeting with Saori.  While Saori didn't completely reject Yukishiro becoming Yuta's second wife, she also didn't agree.

Saori's belief that Yukishiro is Minato's next head remains unchanged. She's given up on Iori, who also seems to have realized he's not fit to be the head.

Yukishiro is Yuta's lover and is already in a relationship with him. She successfully demonstrated her strong resolve to Saori.

Future discussions will depend on the details of the Angels Suit joint venture.  Practical discussions will take place soon, involving only Nanase and business representatives.


Yuta was concerned about Yukishiro's demeanor in the car on the way back.  Even considering the excitement of her reunion with her mother after a long time, she seemed anxious.  When he gently broached the subject, Yukishiro expressed a desire to talk with Akari.

They decided to talk in Yuta's room, and Yukishiro and Akari came.


"Akari-san,"
"Yes?"
"How is your mother doing?"
"Huh? My mother?  She's still working as usual…"

Akari's mother works for Minato.  Akari assumed she was still working.


"Your mother was present at today's meeting."
"What!?"
"What? Your mother was there?"
"Yes. Behind my mother, two women associated with Minato were present. One of them was Akari-san's mother."
"I… I didn't hear anything…"
"I see…"

While Yukishiro trusts Akari most, Akari's family is a prominent one spanning two generations, making Yukishiro a newcomer in that family as a wife.  Why was Akari's mother with Saori?


"I'll ask my mother."
"Yes, please do."

Akari, shocked to learn her mother attended the meeting, left Yuta's room deep in thought.  Once alone with Yuta, Yukishiro leaned in.


"Akari-san's mother was probably there to support my mother."
"Saori-san?"
"Yes. My mother has always been supported by Ena-san."
"That's Ririka-san's mother, right?"
"She was like a mother to me too. But she passed away from illness when I was in first year of middle school… After that, my mother became increasingly unstable because she had no one to rely on."

This resulted in Yukishiro's own emotional instability.


"She's trying to fill Ena-san's role?"
"Perhaps. But other prominent families won't like that."

Yukishiro's heart ached, thinking that if Akari's mother was trying to support Saori, she must be struggling alone without any help.


"For Akari-san…"
"Surely. For her beloved daughter…!"
"Yuta-sama?"
"N-no, nothing."

A severe headache struck Yuta.


(Why? These recent headaches… They're so intense, even if only for a moment.)


"For Akari-san's mother's sake, I want to return to Minato as soon as possible."
"We've left the negotiations to Nanase-san, but hopefully, we'll reach a good conclusion by August. From September… from the second semester…"

Yukishiro smiled happily.


"Yes… I hope to attend classes under Yuta-sama's direct supervision from the second semester."
"Let's make it happen."
"Yes!"

If Yukishiro became Yuta's direct subordinate, the fifteen girls including Akari could become his subordinates.


"I want to spend a lot of time with Yukishiro-san and Akari-san and the others during the remaining class trip."
"Thank you."

Yukishiro had become comfortable being dependent on Yuta.  She found solace in the sweet moments in her beloved's arms.



Yuta continued to actively interact with both the Yoshiwara group and the Minato group.  Nanase returned to Tokyo to focus on negotiations with the Minato side. Takashi, Mizuki, Sakurako, and Naoto stayed at the inn with Yuta, enjoying their time together.


Akari, after hearing from her mother, initially showed some anxiety, but regained her smile through interactions with Yuta.  Her mother apparently took a position working for Saori, having applied for the job herself and gaining Saori’s approval; she started working alongside Saori in July.


Yuta’s proactive engagement deepened his relationship with Akari. They spent more time together as a threesome with Yukishiro, and other girls from Minato group were also always smiling.

They also did a live stream during the class trip.  As promised, Yuta had Tomoe participate in his "Inma Yuu" stream.  Tomoe, in a succubus suit with cat-ear headphones, was incredibly captivating.


"Ahh ♡ Ahh ♡ Ahh ♡"

Tomoe's voice was muted by the microphone, allowing her to moan and enjoy Yuta's caresses.  Women across the nation watching the stream also enjoyed Yuta’s touch.  And so did Aoi and the others.


"Ahhh ♡"
"Mmm ♡ Yuta-sama ♡"
"Hee hee ♡ You're Inma Yuu-sama now ♡"
"That's right ♡"

Aoi, Manami, Yukishiro, and Akari were watching Inma Yuu's stream together, all dressed in succubus suits, dildos at the ready.

Not only Aoi and the others, but the girls at the inn also watched Inma Yuu's stream.  As Yuta entered Tomoe, the dildo moved in sync, bringing pleasure to the women.


Yuta’s interactions were carefully managed to prevent overwork.

Moe and the subordinate girls of the Yoshiwara group delighted Yuta with massages like last year, and Aoi and Manami would later soothe him.  Similarly, Akari and the Minato group girls provided massages, followed by Yukishiro’s comforting care.


Even with Angels Suits and dildos, it was still very demanding.  He’d experienced the difficulty of intimate interactions with numerous women during last year's organizational gathering.  He was grateful for the schedule that accommodated naps and rest days, diligently interacting with everyone as much as possible.



July ended, and August began.  The class trip was nearing its end, and a firework display was held.  Naoto was overjoyed by the fireworks.  Yuta's face softened at the sight of Naoto's innocent excitement.


(He'll be a schoolboy soon…)

He remembered his own past.


(Ouch!)

A severe headache struck him.


(I… cried, didn’t I?)

He remembered himself, crying at parting with his mother.  That image flooded his mind.


(My mother… Ouch!)

His own mother.  She was a kind mother.


(But because of the epidemic… I wasn’t even allowed to see her dying… no, that’s not right, this is different…)


His head throbbed.


"Yuta-sama?"

Aoi noticed something was wrong with Yuta.


"I-I'm fine."
"Your complexion is poor. Let's go back and rest."
"No, the fireworks are still…"
"That won't do. Yuta-sama's health is the most important thing."

Yukishiro also noticed Yuta's pale face and supported him.


"I'm sorry.  Everyone, please enjoy the fireworks."
"Yes. We will let them know."

Moe and Akari nodded.  Yuta, accompanied by Aoi, Yukishiro, Manami, and Tomoe, left the firework display.  Naoto, who had been happily watching the fireworks, spotted Yuta leaving.


"Yuta-nii, are you going home?"

Naoto, who had been shy around Yuta initially, had become close to him after playing together with Takashi.


"Naoto-kun, I'm sorry.  Big brother has to go back for a bit. You enjoy the fireworks until the end."
"Okay! Bye-bye!"

Naoto waved innocently and ran to his mother, Sakurako.


(Bye-bye… bye-bye… bye-bye… I hated it…)

"Ugh!"
"Yuta-sama!"
"I'll arrange for a doctor."

Supported by Aoi and the others, he got into the car. The inn was just a short drive from the firework display.


"Haah… haah… haah…"
"Oh, you're sweating."

Cold sweat began to flow from Yuta's forehead. His breathing was labored.


"Yuta-sama, Yuta-sama."

Supported by Aoi and Yukishiro, his consciousness blurred in the car.  Their voices grew fainter.


(Mother, Mother, why, Mother…)

The headache intensified.  With the increasing pain, he recalled more and more of the past.


(Don’t leave me… don’t die… don’t leave me alone…)

A jumble of memories.


(Lonely, lonely, lonely.)


He heard a voice? Someone screaming?  But he couldn’t hear it.


(Why… why… why…)

His mother had left, leaving him crying. He had run, stumbled, and fallen.


(Why… why… why!)

He suppressed his cries.


(No, no, no! I… I… I!!)


‘Yuta-sama!!’


By the time they arrived at the inn, Yuta had already lost consciousness.  A doctor arrived quickly and examined him, immediately arranging for transport to a nearby hospital.  The doctor said his life wasn't in danger, but Aoi and the others were very worried.


He was admitted to the hospital and slept in his room.  Despite trying to calm themselves, Aoi and the others couldn't sleep and spent the night at the hospital.


First thing in the morning, Tomoe returned to the inn.  Everyone knew that Yuta had fallen ill at the firework display and returned to the inn early. Tomoe informed them of his hospitalization, managing things at the inn to prevent the girls from becoming anxious and confused.


It was a sudden and unexpected event for Yukishiro. Why did Yuta suddenly collapse? And what did Aoi and the others know?


Unable to bear the worry and anxiety, Yukishiro cried all night. Aoi invited her to a separate room.  There, she was told about Yuta’s headaches. They couldn’t tell her about the organization and the memory manipulation yet.


"I'm sorry for keeping it from you."
"No, I understand you couldn't tell me until Yuta-sama decided it was okay."
"He's lost consciousness due to headaches before."
"When was that?"
"He recovered quickly.  Hospital tests showed no problems."
"This time… it's lasting much longer."
"Yes.  He still hasn't woken up…"

Last year during the field trip, Yuta had fainted from a headache after she mentioned the incident. But he woke up when the doctor arrived.  This time, he hadn’t mentioned the incident, only that they watched fireworks together.  They’d also watched fireworks last year.


The fireworks were unlikely to be the cause. What happened to trigger this headache?


"Aoi-sama,"
Manami's voice.
"Yes?"
"A phone call."
"Understood."

Aoi took the call and moved to a private area.  The caller was Ayaka.


Tomoe had contacted Ayaka about Yuta collapsing.  Yuta was scheduled to participate in the organization's gathering after the class trip.  Considering his condition, Aoi wanted to cancel his participation.

To Aoi’s relief, Ayaka called to cancel his participation in the organization’s gathering, and to ensure Yuta rests and that she should tell him that participation had been canceled even if he wanted to attend after recovering.


‘So, the cause is unknown?’
"Yes. We only watched the fireworks together."


Yuta’s rest was decided, but the problem was why he experienced such a severe headache that caused him to faint.  Was it connected to that incident?


‘Please contact me when Yuta-sama wakes up.’
"Yes, immediately."


More than twelve hours had passed since Yuta collapsed. His condition was stable.  His life wasn't in danger.  This hospital was the closest to the inn where the class trip was held, and it had been upgraded with the latest equipment last year.  It was a suitable hospital to monitor Yuta’s condition.


Aoi and the others decided to stay at the hospital until Yuta woke up. Aoi, Yukishiro, and Manami took turns staying by his side, ensuring he would feel reassured upon waking.


However…


Even after a day, even after two days, Yuta did not wake up.


And…


Even after a week, Yuta remained unconscious.
