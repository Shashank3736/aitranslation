Episode 11: The Sleeping Prince ①

A week had passed since Yuta collapsed, and he remained unconscious.  He breathed quietly in his sleep, his physical condition stable.

Aoi and the others, looking haggard, kept vigil by his bedside.  Constantly on edge for a week, they were utterly exhausted.  Although they took turns resting in hospital beds, their hearts found no peace.  They repeatedly cycled between sleeping, waking, and rushing to Yuta's room, their hearts aching at his unconscious state.

The class trip was cut short, and the girls had returned to their respective homes.  News of Yuta's collapse had immediately reached Nanase and the Boss.  Nanase was engaged in discussions with Minato, while the Boss, as Deputy Prime Minister, was occupied with negotiations with the Mir Kingdom, preventing them from immediate action. They spent the week keeping in contact with Aoi and sharing information.

Then, today, Ayaka rushed to the hospital. Tomoe greeted her.

"You're back. It must have been terrible."
"Yes. I don't know what to do anymore."
"Tomoe, you need to rest."

Seeing the severe dark circles under Tomoe's eyes, Ayaka understood the toll the past week had taken.  When she'd first heard about Yuta's collapse, Ayaka felt her heart stop.  His continued unconsciousness had kept her awake with anxiety.

Ayaka’s arrival took a week because she had been meeting with someone and engaging in various discussions.  Aoi and the others had been waiting for the answers she would bring.

"Yukishiro-sama still doesn't know about this, does she?"
"No. Yuta-sama intended to tell her… He planned to tell her before the second semester started."
"I see… Given the circumstances, I think we need to inform Yukishiro-sama of the situation."
"Yes, I agree."
"First… could we see Yuta-sama?"

Entering Yuta's room, they found Aoi, Yukishiro, and Manami watching over him.  Aoi and Manami's expressions brightened slightly upon Ayaka's arrival.  For Yukishiro, Ayaka was merely Yuta's former handler before Tomoe, and she didn't understand why Aoi and the others were so hopeful.

"Yuta-sama…"

Ayaka spoke to the sleeping Yuta.  Only his quiet breathing answered.  Gently grasping his hand, she felt his steady warmth.  Wiping away a tear, she looked at Aoi and the others.

"I have something to tell you. Let's go to a private room."
"Yes."

In the private room, Ayaka heard directly from the doctor about Yuta's current condition.  After the doctor finished, she addressed Aoi.  It wasn't the news they'd hoped for.

"We've received the hospital's data on Yuta-sama's condition and confirmed it ourselves.  Consistent with this hospital's assessment, we judge that Yuta-sama's life is not in immediate danger."
"Yes."

Yukishiro didn't understand what Ayaka meant by "we," but focused on listening.

"Our proposal is to take Yuta-sama to the 'Genetics Research Institute.'"
"The Genetics Research Institute… What would moving Yuta-sama accomplish?"
"We'll have Lilith-san examine Yuta-sama directly."
"Why can't Lilith-san come here? Moving Yuta-sama in his current state is risky."
"Lilith-san has reviewed Yuta-sama's medical data.  She instructed the Boss to bring Yuta-sama to her institute."

This was difficult for Aoi and the others to accept.  It would be understandable if Lilith came to examine Yuta here, but to take him away…  And no one knew what would happen at that institute.

"Will Yuta-sama wake up if we take him to Lilith-san's institute?"
"That… we don't know."
"You don't know? Yet you want to move Yuta-sama?"
"Yes. Lilith-san insisted on bringing him to her institute. She says she can't accurately examine Yuta-sama's condition anywhere else."

This hospital was equipped with state-of-the-art facilities by Yoshiwara for Yuta. There shouldn't be any missing equipment. If something was needed, they could have it immediately.

"I don't agree. Why can't she do it at her own institute?"
"I also…"

Ayaka was also uneasy about letting Lilith examine Yuta. She understood Aoi's apprehension.  But there didn't seem to be any other options.

"If you tell us what equipment is needed, Yoshiwara will provide it.  If it's specialized equipment, we'll move the entire facility here."
"I understand your feelings, Aoi-sama. I feel the same. If possible, I'd prefer Lilith-san to come here and examine Yuta-sama in front of us. However, the result of the discussion between the Boss and Lilith-san was to bring Yuta-sama to the institute…"

Yuta was an irreplaceable member of the organization. He shouldn't be neglected. Aoi believed that although Ayaka and the Boss were in different positions, they shared the same care for Yuta.

Considering Ayaka's demeanor, her words, and the week it took her to arrive, significant internal discussions must have taken place.  Common sense dictated that taking the risk of moving Yuta in his current state was illogical. Lilith should come here.

But Lilith, who might be able to improve Yuta's condition, insisted on her institute.  Therefore, they had no choice but to take Yuta to Lilith's institute.

"Lilith-san… will she be performing an examination to help Yuta-sama regain consciousness?"
"Yes."
"Can we observe the examination?"
"That…"

Ayaka had already asked that question to Lilith.  With a pained expression, she replied:

"No."
"Why not?!"
"She said she wasn't willing to let us."
"Lilith-san belongs to your organization, right? Why doesn't she follow orders from above?!"
"That…"

Even Ayaka didn't understand.  Lilith, considered one of the central figures in Japan's top-secret project… Ayaka had thought the relationship between the Boss and Lilith was different from the master-servant relationship between her and the Boss.

Manami calmed the agitated Aoi. Even though Aoi knew yelling at Ayaka wouldn't help, she couldn't contain her anxiety.

Tomoe then spoke to Yukishiro.

"Yukishiro-sama."
"Y-yes."
"I think you might not understand what's going on."
"Yes. What exactly is happening?"
"This was originally something Yuta-sama was going to tell you. Before the second semester. However, due to this situation, we will explain it. About Yuta-sama."

Tomoe revealed Yuta's memory manipulation to Yukishiro.  Ayaka added details to Tomoe's explanation. Yukishiro was speechless for a moment after hearing the shocking details that happened to Yuta, who had been a recluse.

After recovering from the shock and contemplating, Yukishiro addressed Aoi.

"If we leave Yuta-sama to Lilith-san without our supervision, his memory might be manipulated again. Or something similar might happen."

Aoi nodded slowly.

"Ayaka-san's organization says they can't manipulate Yuta-sama's memory again, but that can't be proven."
"Yes…"
"We need to immediately obtain the documents related to Yuta-sama's memory manipulation, which are being withheld from Yoshiwara, and verify whether a second memory manipulation is truly impossible before entrusting Yuta-sama to Lilith-san."
"That…"
"Are you even aware, Ayaka-san? That a second memory manipulation is truly impossible for Yuta-sama?"

Ayaka was speechless. It was a perfectly logical concern.  She couldn't say anything because she couldn't tell them the truth. Even if she did...

(I don't understand the technology, the theory, anything.)

The result would be the same.

As technology advances, there’s an increasing number of things we use for convenience without understanding how they work.  Genetic manipulation during pregnancy is performed to produce healthier children, but most people don't know the details of the technology. The government says it's a safe technology, but there’s no way to truly know.

The memory manipulation of Yuta—the personality transplant of the Old World man—was a product of Japan's top-secret project. The safety and reliability of the procedure rested solely on Lilith's word.  Given the organization's memory manipulation of Yuta, Aoi and the others found it difficult to fully trust them.

However, the fact remained that there were no other options.

The doctor Yoshiwara trusted most was at this hospital, examining Yuta.  The results showed that the cause of his unconsciousness was unknown.  His physical condition was stable, so his life wasn’t in danger.

If Yuta rested here, he might wake up eventually.  Perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow.  But there was no certainty.  There was even a possibility he might never wake up. Aoi's pained expression perfectly captured the situation.

"I don't know the details of the technology used to manipulate Yuta-sama's memory. I believe only Lilith-san knows. I understand why Aoi-sama doesn't trust us. But the headaches Yuta-sama has are deeply related to the incident.  It's natural for you to be angry at us, the ones who manipulated Yuta-sama's memories. But please… please, let Lilith-san examine Yuta-sama. Please!"

Ayaka bowed deeply, pleading.  Silence followed Aoi’s silence. Ayaka remained bowed, kneeling on the floor.

"Please!"

The worst-case scenario was Yuta remaining unconscious. The Boss had said that Lilith's cooperation was certain.  There was no guarantee that Yuta would wake up even if Lilith examined him, but it might still reveal something.

"Chika…"

A voice, trembling, addressed Ayaka.

"Can you swear… guk…"

Ayaka slowly raised her head. Tears streamed from Aoi's eyes.  Aoi looked intently at Ayaka, her hands clenched, her voice trembling.

"To Yuta-sama… that you won’t harm him… that you’ll conduct a proper examination…"

Ayaka knew her oath was meaningless.  She knew, and Aoi knew.

"I swear! I swear on my life that I won’t harm Yuta-sama!"

After a few seconds of silence, Aoi bit her lip and said:

"Prepare for Yuta-sama's… transfer."

She couldn't rely on anyone else.  The decision rested with Aoi. Even if Nanase were here, the final decision would be Aoi's. With Yuta unconscious, someone had to decide. And that responsibility fell on Aoi.

"We will take Yuta-sama to a Yoshiwara-affiliated hospital near the Genetics Research Institute. We haven't decided to let Lilith-san examine him yet. But… first, we'll get him close…"
"Yes…"

Aoi could trust Ayaka, but not Lilith.  The doctor and scientist who performed the memory manipulation on Yuta… Was she worthy of being entrusted with her most precious person…? Aoi couldn't decide.
