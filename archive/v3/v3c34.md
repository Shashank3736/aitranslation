Episode 34: Layla

"Master Yuuta!?"


On the evening of October 15th, unexpected good news arrived during a boring trip. I'm in Kisarazu for Takuya-sama's school trip.

Takuya-sama wanted to go to a tourist spot, but he'd spent all his money on a trip with Emi and the others during summer vacation, and apparently had nothing left for his school trip.

He asked me to pay for his trip, but I refused because I don't have money either.  It's not that I'm truly broke, but I have no intention of spending money on Takuya-sama.


"He'll be here tomorrow evening, is that right?"
"Yes. He wants to meet Takuya-sama, and Takuya-sama has agreed."


This incredibly wonderful news came from Hanasaki-san, Takuya-sama's handler.  I never imagined Master Yuuta would come to me!

I don't know what business he has with Takuya-sama, but this is my chance!


Furthermore, I hear that two women, Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san, his handlers, will be coming with him.  Aoi and Yukishiro aren't coming, making this an unparalleled opportunity!

I'm scheduled to return to the Meer Kingdom temporarily after this school trip ends.  To have a chance to bring Master Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom before then...what luck!

I call Emi and Monica, who are canoodling with Takuya-sama.


"Master Yuuta will be here tomorrow evening."


This school trip is taking place in a Meer Kingdom special economic zone near Kisarazu.  Trade ships from the Meer Kingdom come and go from the Kisarazu port, so a special zone was established nearby.  Rare metals imported by Japan from the Meer Kingdom are brought here, but other things are brought too...

Illegal aphrodisiacs.

The real reason my mother and others are sent to Japan is to smuggle these illegal aphrodisiacs. I've been helping since I was a middle school student.


Not every trade ship carries illegal aphrodisiacs, but this one does. My mother and the others are currently carefully smuggling the aphrodisiacs into Japan.


I'm helping them under the guise of this school trip.  The cargo transfer will be finished in a few days.  That means there will be empty space on the return trip.


"I'll kidnap Master Yuuta and take him to the Meer Kingdom!"


Once he's inside this special zone, he's mine!


"No, that's impossible, we can't do that."
"That's impossible."
"Huh!?"


Emi and Monica are objecting to my instructions. What's going on!?


"You two could easily kidnap him!"
"Layla-sama, that's not the issue. Even if we were to kidnap Master Yuuta and take him to the Meer Kingdom, what would we do afterwards? It's an international incident."
"Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san, the Japanese handlers, and Hanasaki-san, Takuya-sama's handler, will also be here.  Will you kill them?  That's a huge problem.  Besides, there's no way we'd get permission to put Master Yuuta on the trade ship."
"Ugh! T-this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!"
"That's none of our concern."
"It's none of our concern."
"Wha!? You two are still candidates for the underworld!"
"Layla-sama's instructions are completely unrelated to underworld work."
"Unrelated."
"Grr...This..."


Emi and Monica give me a cold stare.  I can't kidnap Master Yuuta without their help.


"In the first place, don't involve us in this."
"We cherish our relationship with Takuya-sama. We don't want Layla-sama's actions to cause problems for us."
"R-really… you've grown quite attached to Takuya-sama, haven't you?"
"And Layla-sama, why don't you cherish your relationship with Takuya-sama? Compared to the men in the Meer Kingdom, Takuya-sama is truly a wonderful man, isn't he?"
"That's right. Takuya-sama treats us as his own. He's not the type of man who wouldn't mind if we slept with other men."
"Because you're convenient women. If he finds more convenient women, he'll favor them over you, right?"
"That's only natural. If we're not more attractive than other women, that's just how it will be. We just have to stay attractive to be loved more than anyone else by Takuya-sama."
"You'll be told to sleep with other men eventually!  You slept with our mothers' friends!"
"That was because of Takuya-sama's plan. Besides, Takuya-sama didn't particularly like our mothers. They were simply there for pleasure, so it was a mutually beneficial arrangement."
"We don't mind sleeping with other men if it's for Takuya-sama's plan. Compared to our treatment in the Meer Kingdom, it's nothing."


Emi and Monica are lower-ranking royals than me.  In the capital, they're free to hunt for men, but higher-ranking royals get first pick of the good ones. The men left are the kind who only see women as pleasure objects, and their rough and painful treatment is nothing like Takuya-sama's. Takuya-sama's treatment is far more loving compared to the humiliation I suffered when I returned to the Meer Kingdom as a middle schooler.


The low-ranking men in the Meer Kingdom are trash, but there are plenty of good men too. If I raise my rank, I can have my pick of good men.

Well, I understand their feelings. Yuuta-sama and I only have eyes for each other.


I'm not interested in the good men of the Meer Kingdom anymore. It's only Yuuta-sama!


"Takuya-sama is waiting, excuse us."
"Excuse us."
"Wait! Just a moment!"


Emi and Monica leave the room without heeding my call.  They only help with the illegal aphrodisiac smuggling minimally and spend all their time canoodling with Takuya-sama!  They should do some work as underworld candidates!


"If I can't rely on those two…"


Master Yuuta is coming here. What should I do…?


"Layla-san"
"Y-yes!"


Hanasaki-san's voice from outside the room.  I open the door to find her with her usual smile.  Hanasaki-san's smile...it's somehow frightening.


"Regarding tomorrow's meeting between Takuya-sama and Master Yuuta, would it be alright if I leave guiding Master Yuuta to the room to you, Layla-san?"
"O-of course!"
"Before the discussion with Takuya-sama, I need to talk to Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san for a bit.  That will take about an hour. We'll be present for Takuya-sama's meeting, so for a short time...would you mind keeping Master Yuuta company?"
"Y-yes!"


Yes!  What wonderful news! Oh… Hanasaki-san, you were my cupid.


"Master Yuuta's visit to Takuya-sama is being kept secret.  He'll be arriving discreetly, so please be careful, Layla-san."
"Yes!"


I'll be alone with Master Yuuta! Should I kidnap him then? No, as Emi and the others said, even if I kidnap Master Yuuta, I wouldn't know what to do afterward. If I can't even get him on the ship…


"At 5 PM tomorrow, a car carrying Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san will arrive at the hotel's front entrance.  The car carrying Master Yuuta will arrive at the back entrance at 5:30 PM.  Please guide him from the back entrance to the first-floor reception room and have him wait there for about 30 minutes. Please take care of Master Yuuta."
"Yes! Leave it to me!"


Tomoe and Ayaka are going separately!  Going to such lengths to keep his visit a secret. I don't know what business he has with Takuya-sama, but I should thank Takuya-sama too!


In that case…there's only one way left.  I'll sneak in tonight…if I only get one dose…

I used a diluted version on Takuya-sama, but with the original concentration…

Master Yuuta will become someone who can't live without me!


This is a chance given by God! In 30 minutes, I'll captivate Master Yuuta with my body!  Then we'll spend our lives together, only wanting each other!


Hee hee… he he he… hahaha!  Aoi and Yukishiro, I'll make you forget them with my body. Yuuta-sama said many times that he only needs me!

Ah, I can't wait until tomorrow. In my succubus suit…no, that won't do. If I use the succubus suit now and get tired… I have to sneak in at night…no, I should help at night…


I'll contact my mother immediately and tell her I'll help with the smuggling at night.  Why would she be surprised that I'm offering to help when her daughter volunteered?

Really…I don't need anyone but Master Yuuta.  Ah, I want to create a world just for the two of us soon.  A paradise just for the two of us, where we'll always love each other…




That night, I left the hotel to help with the smuggling.
