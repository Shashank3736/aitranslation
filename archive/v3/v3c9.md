Episode 9: The Meeting

July 20th.

An informal meeting with Saori takes place.

Yukishiro, along with Nanase, Mizuki, Yuuta, and Tomoe—five people in total—head to the meeting location.

Only Yukishiro, Nanase, and Mizuki enter the room for the meeting with Saori.

Yuuta volunteers to stay nearby in case anything happens, and Tomoe accompanies him.


A hotel near the border between Yoshiwara's and Minato's summer resorts.

Yukishiro and the others, having arrived 30 minutes early, proceed to the meeting room at the scheduled time, leaving Yuuta and Tomoe behind.


Saori is already waiting in the room.

Three other women are present.

One is a government observer.  Even though it's informal, the government has sent a representative.


The remaining two are Minato associates known to Yukishiro.

However, upon seeing one of them, Yukishiro is inwardly shocked.  Why is she here?


"Please, have a seat."


The government observer seems to be leading the meeting.

Yukishiro sits in the middle, with Nanase and Mizuki on either side.


"Now then, let's begin our discussion.  Essentially, this is a matter concerning parent and child.  Ms. Saori and Ms. Yukishiro, please engage in a constructive conversation."


The observer says this much, then sits silently.


Mother and daughter gaze at each other.  It's their first reunion in about eight months.


"It's been a while."


Yukishiro speaks first.


"Mother, and to everyone from Minato, I apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused."


She bows deeply. Yukishiro fully understands the implications of her actions.


Saori says nothing in response to her daughter's apology.  She simply stares.


"Ms. Saori,"


One of the Minato associates, a woman with a somewhat stern expression, speaks up.


"Look up."


Responding to the voice, Saori addresses Yukishiro, then turns her gaze to Nanase beside her.


"My foolish daughter is in your care."
"It's nothing much.  Yukishiro-san is a wonderful young woman who can handle everything herself."


Saori is three years younger than Nanase, making her 36 this year.  She's taller than Nanase and Mizuki, standing at 166cm.  Saori has naturally auburn hair and a strikingly beautiful face, like a work of art. Saori and Yukishiro are very much alike, a mother and daughter who resemble each other. She looks remarkably young for 36.  She possesses the beauty and grace befitting the head of the Minato eternal family.


The meeting begins with small talk between Saori and Nanase, despite it not being an appropriate context. It's a sort of light greeting before getting to the main topic.  After a while, Saori brings up the main issue.


"Yukishiro-san,"
"Yes,"
"It's not working with Iori."
"But the first semester just ended."
"Whether the second semester ends or the year ends, it's impossible. We knew that from the start."


Iori's training to become the head is not progressing well.  She has a mountain of things to do, but she keeps running away from them.


"It seems Iori herself understands she can't do it."
"I… see."


Yukishiro had planned to watch Iori's growth until the end of her first year, but Iori has already given up.


"You are Minato's next head. Come back immediately."
"Does that mean you accept my wishes?"


At Yukishiro's words, Saori's expression hardens with anger.


"You mean that nonsense about marrying Yuuta-sama?"
"It's not nonsense. I'm serious."
"Have you grown fond of Yoshiwara?"
"Yes.  They have been incredibly kind to me, and I am very grateful."


A sharp sound, indicative of a strong grip, comes from Saori's fan.


"Minato and Yoshiwara are incompatible.  Having the same husband is unthinkable."
"There's no such law."
"Well!"


The stern-faced woman exclaims, her eyes full of disbelief and reproach.


"Do you have no awareness of your responsibilities as Minato's next head?!"


Her gaze is not enough; she also adds a reprimand.  Mizuki responds to this.


"There is no one who possesses more awareness of their responsibilities as the next head than Yukishiro-san."
"What did you say?!"
"Raising your voice won't lead to a productive conversation."


The woman's lips tremble at Mizuki's calm smile.  Yoshiwara and Minato have always been rivals in Tokyo.  Yoshiwara, centered around Nanase, has built a solid foundation.  Minato, on the other hand, is centered around Saori, but since losing Ena, various cracks have appeared. The stern woman's lack of composure perfectly reflects Minato's own lack of composure.


"Ms. Saori,"


Nanase speaks in a calm voice.


"Yukishiro-san and Yuuta-sama are in love."
"Love?"
"Yes, love."


Saori finds the idea unbelievable.


"With a man she's only been with for a few months?  That's not love, is it?"


Yukishiro replies to Saori's words.


"It is. I am in love with Yuuta-sama."
"You're mistaken. To think Yuuta-sama would deceive you..."
"Yuuta-sama is not that kind of man."
"He's engaged to the next head of Yoshiwara.  It wouldn't be strange if he were using you to benefit Yoshiwara."


Saori's thoughts are quite natural for the head of Minato.


"Ms. Saori,"


Nanase speaks again.


"No matter what Yuuta-sama says, Yukishiro-san would never do anything harmful to Minato.  You, of all people, should know she has the judgment to make such distinctions."
"Men change women."


Nanase smiles at that statement.


"Yes, men change women.  Yukishiro-san has changed by connecting with Yuuta-sama. She will surely become a wonderful head of Minato."
"…Connected?"


Yukishiro, with a strong determination, raises her voice.


"Yuuta-sama confessed to me."
"!"
"As lovers, Yuuta-sama and I have spent a night together."
"What?!"


This shocks not only Saori and the stern woman, but also the government observer and the other woman.


"Yukishiro-san, you…"
"Yes. Yuuta-sama embraced me."
"What have you done?!"


Saori glares at Nanase.


"We did nothing. Yuuta-sama and Yukishiro-san are in love and have become a couple."
"That's a lie!"
"It's not a lie! I am in love with Yuuta-sama, and he loves me!"


A daughter desperately pleading with her mother.  A mother glaring at that daughter.


No matter how much she is glared at, Yukishiro is unwavering in her resolve.  She will not yield on this.


"I will become Yuuta-sama's wife!  As his second wife, please allow me to serve as the head of the Minato eternal family!"


Yukishiro's cry rings through the room. When her voice ceases, silence descends, enveloping the room.


In the silence, the sound of Saori's fan, seemingly about to break, rings out. Nanase breaks the silence.


"Ms. Saori. As the head of Yoshiwara, I promise that we will never do anything to harm Minato through Yuuta-sama."


She glances sideways at the government observer.


"And… we want to work together with Minato on projects for the women of the world."
"Projects for the women of the world?"


The government observer reacts.


"You mean to say, you want Minato to collaborate on the Angel Suit project?"
"Yes."
"I believe that project should be under the government's control…"


The Succubus Suit is under the control of the Organization of Demons, while the Angel Suit is under Yoshiwara's control. The organization's members are ordinary citizens, but the organization's activities are heavily government-influenced. It was considered a secret organization, but in reality, high-ranking officials, including the Prime Minister, knew of its existence from the beginning.  And they are promoting policies using sex toys such as the Succubus Suit, primarily through the Organization of Demons.


Yoshiwara's Angel Suit, unlike the widespread Succubus Suit, is currently only available in Tokyo. If Yoshiwara and Minato were to team up to expand the Angel Suit to other areas with male-only zones, it would be an unacceptable situation for other eternal families.


Therefore, other eternal families have begun investigations.  The rights involved are somewhat complex.  Even if they discover that the inventor of the Succubus Suit is Yuuta, it doesn't affect the rights to the Angel Suit.  However, the Angel Suit is based on the Succubus Suit.  Even if they were accused of stealing the technology, Yuuta is unconcerned, so Yoshiwara can assert its rights to the Angel Suit. And the rights to the Succubus Suit and dildos belong to the Organization of Demons.


The rights situation is somewhat complicated, but Yuuta remains at the core. If Yuuta were to take a liking to a woman from another eternal family and wish to give them these rights as well, they would have no choice but to comply.  The possibility is low for now, but the future is uncertain. After all, Yuuta is only 17 years old.


"I want Yoshiwara and Minato to team up and grow this into a project for the benefit of society."


Nanase judges that this observer is unaware of Yuuta's deeper circumstances. When she heard that the government was sending an observer to this meeting, she thought someone from the organization would come. However, the observer who arrived was a high-ranking official she didn't know well.


"Th-The Angel Suit project… with Minato…"


The stern woman hesitates at Nanase's words, but a hint of unconcealed joy creeps into her voice.  She's probably calculating various rights and the resulting profits.


"What do you think? This isn't a bad deal for Minato, is it?"
"…"


Saori's expression doesn't change. Her anger seems unyielding; she clenches her lips, maintaining a stern expression.


"We're thinking of having a wedding on Yuuta-sama's birthday next year, depending on his feelings."
"…"
"With Aoi and Yukishiro-san together as brides."
"…"


Yoshiwara is making considerable concessions.  This problem is essentially unrelated to Yoshiwara. The Angel Suit project, Yuuta's second wife, the joint wedding—none of it benefits Yoshiwara.  Even protecting Yukishiro is not advantageous for Yoshiwara.


Nevertheless, Nanase acted.  Because her beloved daughter Aoi wished it, because Yuuta wished it. And because Nanase also cared for Saori.


But Saori's anger doesn't subside.  Even with these concessions, her inner turmoil doesn't fade; indeed, it seems to intensify.


(Where does this anger come from…?)


Nanase believes that her own highly publicized, grand romance put pressure on Saori. She doesn't know Minato's situation, but she is aware of Saori's escape from a man she knew in middle school and the subsequent events. It must have been a humiliation for Saori, but she was blessed with two children. She hears that her husband is living peacefully.


(But…)


She remembers what Yukishiro told her.


(Why didn't she attend the Holy Night Festival?)


Saori always said she would attend the Holy Night Festival and would go every year.  However, no one ever saw her there.  Despite the large venue, if Saori, the head of the Minato eternal family, were there, people would notice.


(Saori-sama's husband is… supposedly spending his time peacefully at his summer resort…)


A dull sound, like something breaking, comes from Saori's tightly clenched fan.


"I… understand. I want to discuss the details of the joint project with Yoshiwara… at a practical level."
"Yes.  Let's arrange that soon."
"That will be all for today."


The meeting ends. Yukishiro is already bound to Yuuta.  Minato's remaining options are to make Yukishiro the head as Yuuta's second wife, or to forcibly make Iori the head, though she herself has given up. While examining the details of the joint project with Yoshiwara, they will need to decide.


Nanase and Mizuki rise, followed by Yukishiro.  Gazing at their mother, whose expression seems to be a mixture of anguish and anger, they leave the room.


Saori, the other women, and the government observer remain in the room.  The stern woman speaks to Saori, but…


"Leave me alone for a while."


At the response, the stern woman leaves the room. The other woman is concerned about the observer staying, but gently tells Saori, "I'll prepare for your departure; I'll be waiting," and leaves the room.


Only Saori and the government observer remain.  Seeing that Saori doesn't move, the observer gets up.


"The government hopes that Yukishiro-sama will become the head, even as Yuuta-sama's second wife. It would be nice if we could secure as much of the Angel Suit's influence as possible."


Saori doesn't respond.


"Please allow us to send a representative to join the practical-level discussions on the joint project with Yoshiwara. Please contact us once you've set a date."
"…"


The observer leaves Saori alone in the room. From the window, she sees Yukishiro and the others getting into their car.  Yuuta is also there.


(My scheme to control the next generation of Minato has backfired.)


She watches the car drive away, her gaze fixed on a woman who was present at the meeting.


(She was allowed to attend this meeting, so Saori-sama must like her.  Well… she won't be able to replace Ena, but…)


The observer turns back, gazing at the room where Saori remains.


(Unable to achieve her own love, overtaken by her daughter… a mother… Jealousy isn't a sufficient word. I can't understand what she's feeling, but I sympathize.)
