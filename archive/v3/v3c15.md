Episode 15: The Sleeping Prince ④

Obscene sounds—a slurping and gurgling—echoed through the research lab.  Layla, having lowered Yuuta’s pants and underwear, was orally pleasuring his already erect penis.

Lila had told Layla to suck Yuuta’s penis, and having received permission from the lab’s director, Lilith, Layla was trembling with ecstasy as she performed the act.

This ideal Yuuta was a figment of Layla’s imagination, born from her own desires within the VR game, "Yinma Yu."

Sleeping soundly, Yuuta didn't respond to Layla's murmurs as she fervently pleasured him.  This pleased Layla; the lack of denial allowed her to believe he was enjoying it.  Indeed, Yuuta’s penis, fully erect, was hard, thick, and long, leaving no doubt of his arousal.


“Jubo… jubo… Yuuta-sama… ♡”


Lilith and Lila showed no interest in Layla’s actions, instead exchanging opinions while monitoring Yuuta’s vital signs.  Lilith had begun examining Yuuta immediately after he was brought to the lab.  His brain and body showed no abnormalities.  As Yoshiwara’s doctor had confirmed, he didn't have any life-threatening conditions.  However, he remained unconscious, having slept for over a week.


“When will we get the suitable’s sperm?”
“Once he turns eighteen, sperm donation will begin.  Naturally, he’ll be transferred to your country then.”
“So Japan’s age of consent is eighteen.  We should have him donate sperm as soon as he’s capable.”
“That’s not for us to decide.  It’s the Japanese administrator’s decision.”
“Even if he isn’t Adam, he’s a suitable. He can negate the ‘curse’ of a significant number of women. We should secure his sperm donation as soon as possible.”


Lilith sighed inwardly.  If they needed recessive genes that negate the curse in many women, they should find a suitable person within their own country.  Relying on other countries for this, highlighting the limitations of the Mear Kingdom’s ‘management,’ meant certain destruction.  The Mear Kingdom’s society was only prolonging its existence by receiving sperm and genetic engineering technology from various countries in exchange for rare metals mined only within their borders.


“What was your specialty again?” Lilith asked Lila.


“Memory.”
“Ah, yes, that’s right.”


Each individual possessed unique specialized abilities. Lilith specialized in genes—the soul itself. Lila’s specialty was memory, making her ideally suited to examine Yuuta's condition.


“He’s a suitable, but it seems he has memories he doesn’t want to recall.”
“Which memories are those?”
“The memories of the boy from the old world.  After awakening, he thought he was a man from the old world for a while.”
“Even after the fusion?”
“Yes. Isn’t that strange? Perhaps the memories he doesn’t want to recall made him believe he was a man from the old world.”
“We lack the equipment here to view memory regions.  If we transported him to the Mear Kingdom…”


Lila wouldn’t harm Yuuta, the suitable.  Whether Layla, or other individuals in the Mear Kingdom, understood this was another matter. And what Aoi and the others thought was a separate issue entirely.  If he didn't wake up, having Yuuta examined in the Mear Kingdom to view his memory regions would be an effective measure. However…


“The suitable princesses will make a fuss, so transporting him to the Mear Kingdom should be a last resort.”
“Right. Do you know what the memories he doesn't want to recall are about?”
“Ah, well…”


Lilith recounted the incident that occurred during Yuuta’s first service activity. As Lila finished listening, Yuuta's vital signs changed.


“Nn…!! ♡”


Layla cried out joyfully as she eagerly drank the semen released from Yuuta's penis. Yuuta had ejaculated while Layla was pleasuring him. Lilith and Lila, devoid of emotion, observed the changes in his vital signs. The changes seemed to be within their predictions.


“Normal?”
“Yes.  It seems there’s still no problem with his body.”
“From what we’ve heard, it doesn't seem to be simply terror. If the reason the suitable isn't waking up is truly that incident…”
“How can we wake him up?”


After swallowing all of Yuuta’s semen, Layla happily began performing a post-coital cleanup. Lila looked at Layla impassively and said:


“We should let him meet her.”
“The woman who assaulted the suitable?”
“Yes. If he reacts, good. If not, we just look for another reason.”
“Certainly.”


Lilith thought inwardly that the princesses would surely make a fuss about this, but it was a method that might elicit some reaction from Yuuta. Yuuta had told Aoi and the others that he had suppressed painful memories. Since it was a reason Yuuta himself had devised, it must hold meaning.  Lilith considered letting Suzune meet Yuuta, when she heard Layla’s excited voice.


“Ah, um!  If, if you need more… I, I’ll do it until the end!”


Layla began to undress.  She genuinely believed she should have sex with Yuuta there and then.


“That’s enough. We have the data.”
“Bu-but…”
“It would be good to give him the suitable’s seed.”
“After the suitable’s sperm is exported to your country, your administrators will decide if the child is suitable, won't they?”


In Layla’s fantasy, Yuuta was a man who desired only her. Meeting him here, while he was confined by Aoi, was fate.  She truly believed she should have sex with him right then.


“So-such! Please!”
“No. He’s already ejaculated, so we can’t force him.”
“That’s right. Did you drink all the semen?”
“Ye-yes…”
“What a waste. Oh well.  Next time.”
“Can I come again?”


Lilith sighed openly.


“You don’t have to come again.”
“It’s fine. It’s been a while since we’ve had a suitable. Let me observe the various examinations.”


She would have certainly refused if Lila hadn’t offered.  But since it was Lila, she had to cooperate as much as possible.  That was the rule.


“Understood.  But make it nighttime.  During the day, ordinary scientists come and go here.”
“I’ll come again tomorrow night. After confirming whether the suitable has awakened, I intend to return to the Mear Kingdom.”
“Yes. If we can’t do anything here, I might ask for your cooperation.”
“Understood.”


Lila abruptly left after finishing what she had to say.  Surprised by Lila’s sudden departure, Layla quickly followed after her.


Lilith cleaned Yuuta’s groin and right hand with a warm towel.  Layla… was Lila’s responsibility.  She had spoken of things only the administrators should know.  She didn't know how much of Lilith and Lila's conversation Layla, who had been engrossed in sucking Yuuta's penis, had heard.  Even if she had heard, she probably wouldn't have understood it.


(To what extent she perceived the conversation… I suppose we can ‘view her memories’ when we return to the Mear Kingdom.)


Lila’s specialty was memory.  In the Mear Kingdom, they would view Layla’s memories and take necessary measures if needed.


Lilith and Lila were ‘the same being.’  Yet, despite being the same, they possessed different abilities, and their personalities developed through their learning experiences.


(If we don’t eliminate the curse, men won’t be born.)


In Japan, artificial insemination was performed using combinations that allowed the expression of recessive genes capable of negating the curse.  If the sperm compatibility was high enough but the recessive genes that could negate the curse couldn’t be expressed, genetic manipulation was performed on the woman to enable her to negate the curse through fertilization with that sperm.  While artificial insemination was sometimes permitted when there was a need for population maintenance, even if the curse couldn’t be negated, this hadn’t been done in recent years.


Even ordinary citizens, and even prominent families, including the five great families, were unaware of this fact.  Only the women selected as administrators knew this truth.


(The curse gene…)


All women in this world possessed a gene that Lilith and the administrators called the ‘curse.’  As long as this curse gene existed, men wouldn’t be born.


(The beginning was from destruction.)


The reasons for the destruction of the old world were not just one. Various factors combined to lead to its downfall.


(Technology advanced as it approached divine wisdom.  But it couldn't achieve technological advancement sufficient to maintain the overall civilization of society.)


In the old world, individuals who greatly advanced technology sometimes appeared.  Many of these advancements were brought about by the manifestation of wisdom hidden by God within humanity.  Advanced technology caused a population explosion in just 200 years.  However, technological advancements capable of sustaining the entire population in harmony with the Earth's environment never occurred.


(Why did God hide wisdom within humans? Even though it would eventually manifest. Was it something unavoidable, even with divine wisdom?  Did God want people to remain ignorant and innocent forever… or did God want them to become like God…?)


Amid the decline of the old world’s civilization, the 'Noah's Ark' project, a plan for human survival, was implemented.  In the ark, the chosen people lived while advancing technology, but conflicts inevitably arose.  The conflict never ceased.


Then, one day…


A person raised in the ark discovered the curse gene from God's wisdom.  That person was a man.  He also discovered the recessive gene that negates the curse.


(And the curse was cast.)


He cast the curse upon the women in the ark.  Using his position as a brilliant scientist and doctor.  Even Lilith, a specialist in genetics, didn't know how he caused the normally unexpressed curse gene to manifest in women.


Women with the curse gene couldn’t bear male children.  However, if the recessive gene that negates the curse is expressed at the moment of fertilization, a male child would be born. There was more than one recessive gene that negates the curse, and the conditions for its expression varied.  For example, Male A’s sperm might negate the curse with Female A, but not with Female B.  Even if the conditions were met, the probability of the recessive gene that negates the curse manifesting at the moment of fertilization was one in ten thousand with artificial insemination.  In the case of direct sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, this probability does slightly increase, but the reason is unknown.


(Even after noticing the situation, they couldn't find the cause.)


In the ark, men stopped being born for an unknown reason. The plan for human survival was forced to undergo major changes.  Everyone desperately strived for human survival.


(The desperate struggle to live. Being constantly in competition.  Constantly changing.  If these things are formed in a world with few men, an ideal society might… be built.)


That was a possibility considered by that person, but what would actually happen… was unknown until they tried.


(By fusing the old world's… ‘one’s soul’ into the vessel of a suitable, it's possible to express the recessive genes that negate the curse of many women.  But the boys born between the suitable and women are ordinary boys, not suitable.  Even with a suitable, the probability of the recessive gene that negates the curse manifesting remains one in ten thousand. Even if a suitable appears, the desperate struggle for human survival remains the same.)


The suitable is not God, nor Adam.


(Adam, a miraculous person who would erase the curse itself from women…)


The creator created Lilith and others with the goal of finding Adam.  That purpose was firmly ingrained in Lilith's memory.  However…


(He probably doesn't exist… Adam…)


Lilith's examination continued late into the night.
