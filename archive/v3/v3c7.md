Episode 7: Class Trip ⑦

Yuta's birthday party began on the evening of July 17th.  Aoi and Yukishiro greeted him as he entered. Manami stood behind Aoi, and Akari behind Yukishiro.

The 15 girls of Minato's group, including Akari, were all dressed in dresses. They had brought them knowing beforehand about Yuta's party.

The 15 girls were moved and delighted by the sight of Yukishiro and Aoi welcoming Yuta. They deeply thanked Yuta and Yoshiwara for cherishing Yukishiro.

(It's not easy, but this generation should be able to build a good relationship.)

Nanase also looked happy, watching the girls unite around Yuta.

Yuta's birthday party proceeded in a warm atmosphere. People came one after another to offer their congratulations.  Among them were Takashi and Naoto.

"Congratulations!"
"Thank you."
"Congratulations."
"Thank you, Naoto-kun, too."

Four-year-old Naoto, clinging to Takashi's leg, shyly congratulated Yuta.

"Congratulations."
"Thank you, Sakurako-san."

After congratulating Yuta, Naoto immediately clung to his mother, Sakurako's, leg. He was still at the age where he wanted to be pampered.

"He's so cute."
"He is, isn't he? I can't believe how cute boys can be.  I never thought I was that cute when I was a boy!"
"Ahaha, that's true."

Takashi watched Naoto clinging to Sakurako with a happy look.  Both Takashi and Yuta had once been like that, clinging to their mothers.

(Ouch!!!)

As he recalled that memory, a sharp pain struck Yuta.

"Yuta-sama?"
"I'm fine."

Aoi immediately noticed the change.  So did Manami, Tomoe, and Nanase.

"What's wrong?"
"No, nothing."

Takashi didn't know what happened, but he noticed the atmosphere around Aoi and the others had changed instantly.

"Congratulations, Yuta-sama."

At that moment, Mizuki arrived.  With chestnut hair like Manami's, healthy skin, and a gentle, kind face, Yuta had met her many times before. Mizuki knew everything about Yuta's situation.

"Thank you, Mizuki-san."
"Thank you so much for being so loving with Manami and Aoi-sama!~"
"A, ahaha. I'm the one who's happy every day."
"Oh my~! To hear you say that~! Manami is truly fortunate~! Takashi-sama! We can't be outdone!"
"That's right!"
"A, ahaha."
"I also want to be lovey-dovey with Takashi-sama~. I'll borrow Takashi-sama for a bit~! "
"Whoa whoa, it doesn't have to be now."
"Don't worry about me. Please enjoy yourselves."
"Yuta-kun, sorry.  I'll be back later."
"Yes."
"Come on, let's go~!~"

(She's as bright as ever.)

Mizuki swept Takashi away like a whirlwind.  While she was aware of Yuta's condition and intentionally took Takashi away, Mizuki was normally a cheerful person. Every time they met, she told funny stories and made him laugh.

(And then, I get to see Manami's smug face.)

When Mizuki, Manami's mother, made Yuta laugh, Manami would always have a proud, smug look on her face, which Yuta liked.

"Yuta-sama, would you like to rest for a bit?"
"No, I'm fine."
"But…"
"I really am fine. It was just a moment."

Yuta thought these momentary headaches were unavoidable and beyond his control.

(Is my heart sensing something? Or am I afraid of something?)

Before, he thought the headaches were related to "Yuta-kun's memories." Now, he believed they stemmed from "his own memories."

(My only name is 'Yuta'. If I'm a man from the Old World, why don't I have a name? I've always called myself 'Yuta'.)

"Yuta-sama."

The delicate woman calling that name was Moe.  Moe, who was striving to become Yuta's lover, had grown into a respectable lady, comparable to the daughters of prominent families.  She hadn't grown much taller, but she had developed beautifully, possessing a wonderful figure.


"Congratulations."
"Thank you."
"Would you please accept my birthday present?"
"Of course, happily."

Moe's birthday present was a handkerchief embroidered with morning glories, the same as Yukishiro's. However, the color of the morning glories was light purple. Many girls gave Yuta handkerchiefs embroidered with morning glories as birthday gifts, just like Moe.  Short swords were given after receiving fans, according to custom.

"You're using the handkerchief, aren't you?"
"Of course!"

Yuta had given Moe a handkerchief with her birth flower, montbretia, on it for her birthday. The flower's meaning was "humble beauty."

Following Moe, the other girls in the class came one after another to give their congratulations and birthday presents.  All of them were potential romantic partners. He didn't want to treat anyone unfairly, which made the process take a long time.


(I can't afford to rest because of a little headache.)

The headache he'd just had was more severe than usual.  Even Aoi and the others wouldn't have noticed that.


(The pain disappeared instantly. I'm fine.)


Yuta's birthday party continued as he received congratulations and presents from the girls in his class and the Minato group.


Meanwhile…

Takashi, taken away by Mizuki, had reunited with Sakurako and Naoto.

"Naoto-kun, you're getting cuter and cuter~!~"

Naoto blushed at Mizuki's words and hid behind Sakurako.

"He takes after Sakurako-san~!~ They say boys resemble their mothers~."
"Oh, come on, he's just like me when I was little!"
"Oh, you're kidding~!~"

Takashi and Mizuki's relationship hadn't changed since they met in middle school. The strong and boisterous Takashi and the incredibly cheerful Mizuki often joked and laughed together. Mizuki would say things to men that others wouldn't dare say even as a joke, and Takashi would laugh heartily. Their close friendship had been well-known since middle school.

"We appreciate your kindness, Mizuki-sama and Nanase-sama."
"Sakurako-san~!~ Let's not use such formal language~!~"


Since Sakurako gave birth to Naoto, Takashi had made time for him, acting as a father and watching him grow. This was unusual.

While pregnancy resulting from direct sexual intercourse with a male is more likely to produce a boy, the probability is close to one in ten thousand. Therefore, it is rare for a man to become a father through his wife or lover giving birth to a boy.  Furthermore, even if a man becomes a father, most do not participate in their son's upbringing.  Takashi's devotion to Naoto's upbringing was truly exceptional.

This also meant less time with his wife, Nanase, and Mizuki. Since Naoto's birth, Sakurako had spent about as much time with Takashi as Nanase and Mizuki.

"Please indulge me for a little while longer."

Naoto had less than two years until he started elementary school. This was Sakurako's last chance to lavish affection on her son.

"I don't think of it as indulgence.  I'm more apologetic that Sakurako-san has to listen to Takashi-sama's whims."
"Indeed!  Gahhaha!"

Takashi laughed heartily, then made eye contact with Nanase, who was smiling from a short distance away.

"I'm going to go to Nanase for a bit."
"Goodbye."

Takashi walked towards Nanase with a smile.

"They look like they're having fun."
"My husband and Mizuki-san are always fun to watch."

Takashi leaned in close to Nanase's ear.

"About that matter… is it still difficult?"

Nanase's expression turned serious.

"I haven't given up yet. But the situation remains difficult."
"I see.  I'm sorry to ask you to do so much."
"No, if it's my husband's request, I will do my best no matter what."

Takashi looked at Sakurako laughing with Mizuki, and Naoto laughing at Sakurako's feet.

"Even if it's decided, when faced with the reality of choosing…"
"I understand your feelings."

Takashi clenched his fist.

Naoto would be leaving his mother's side in two years. At that time, his mother would have to make a choice.

There were two scenarios.

One, if the boy was born in an area without a men-only zone. In this case, the mother and son would first move to a nearby area with a men-only zone. They would live together in the men-only zone until the son started elementary school, and the mother would then return to her original residence. The mother would then be forbidden to enter the son's area and see him.

Two, if the boy was born in an area with a men-only zone. Sakurako falls under this category.  In this case, they would also live together in the men-only zone of that area until elementary school. If the son attends an elementary school in that men-only zone, the mother must move to another area. The mother would then be forbidden to enter the son's area and see him.

Conversely, if the mother remained in the area, the son would have to move to another men-only zone. In this case as well, the mother would be forbidden from entering the son's area and seeing him.

Both scenarios were laws designed to separate mothers and sons.

If Nanase had given birth to a boy, that child would have moved to a men-only zone outside of Tokyo.  This was because Nanase, the head of the Yoshiwara Eternal Family, had no choice but to remain in Tokyo.

Sakurako wanted to keep Naoto in Tokyo. This meant Sakurako would leave Tokyo in two years and never be able to return.

Takashi could visit Sakurako wherever she moved; there were no restrictions on that.  However, he would be forbidden from seeing Naoto.

This was due to the once-powerful influence of mothers on their sons.

In the past, women who gave birth to boys were called "holy mothers" and were given certain privileges. Their strong influence over their sons led to increased political influence, eventually causing major problems in the governance of the country. As a result, mothers can now only live with their sons until the age of six, separating at the start of elementary school.

In exchange for separation from their sons, various benefits are promised: housing, lump-sum payments, pensions, and various preferential treatment.  Yet, some mothers still dislike the separation. However, no exceptions are allowed. Disobedience is a serious crime.

Even the power of the Yoshiwara Eternal Family couldn't change that. Takashi had asked Nanase to negotiate with the government on Sakurako's behalf, hoping she could somehow remain in Tokyo. He promised to avoid seeing Naoto. However, the government's response was that no exceptions were allowed.

If Naoto moved, Sakurako could remain in Tokyo. However, Sakurako did not intend to choose this option.

Even for ordinary citizens, the mother usually moves. The largest number of boys are born to women in the large general citizen population.

When a woman living in Tokyo gives birth to a boy through artificial insemination, she lives with him in a men-only zone.  Then, when her son starts elementary school, she moves to another area. She wouldn't move her son from Tokyo, where he has made friends in kindergarten. It's all for the sake of the boy.

Sakurako, a member of a prominent family, feels the same way. Many of Naoto's friends would likely remain in Tokyo after elementary school. She doesn't want to suddenly force a boy who's only in first grade to live in an unfamiliar place.

Prominent families and ordinary citizens share the same feelings as mothers.

The time of Sakurako and Naoto's separation was steadily approaching.
