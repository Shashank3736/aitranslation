Episode 40: The Last Day of Second Year High School

March 31st.

Yuuta's second year of high school has ended.

Tomorrow, he begins his third year.


Over the course of his second year, Yuuta's own problems and Minato's problems were resolved.

Yuuta continues to have smooth relationships with Aoi and Yukishiro.

In addition to his lovers Manami, Akari, and Moe, his relationships with Ayaka and Tomoe, who have now become official lovers, are also going well.


This July, he will hold a wedding ceremony with Aoi and Yukishiro.

Preparations have already begun, and the joint wedding ceremony by Yoshiwara and Minato will be the most luxurious ever seen.

Furthermore, Nanase, the head of the Yoshiwara family, and Saori, the head of the Minato family, have been interacting while planning Yuuta and their daughters' wedding.


At their first wedding planning meeting, Saori apologized to Nanase and Mizuki.  She apologized for having harbored unilateral hostility towards them.

Then, she told Nanase and Mizuki about herself.

Saori felt she needed to tell them in order to build a good relationship between Yoshiwara and Minato in the future.

Yukishiro has conveyed this to Aoi and Manami.


Upon hearing Saori's story, Nanase and Mizuki cried and embraced Saori.

Nanase had never approved of the historical rivalry between the heads of the Yoshiwara and Minato families.  A cutthroat rivalry is fine. But she saw no reason for a hostile rivalry.

After hearing Saori's story and sharing their secret, Nanase and Mizuki also told Saori about their own secret.

This was something even Aoi and Manami didn't know.



"Please keep this a secret."

"O-of course."

"Hehehe, now we share a secret, Saori-sama."


Nanase's secret, compared to Saori's, is quite insignificant – just a little behind-the-scenes story of Nanase's epic love story.

Nevertheless, they were able to share a secret, forging a bond.

Saori likely gained a sense of unity with Nanase and Mizuki.



After successfully completing the wedding, Yuuta plans to have a child with Ayaka.

Due to age considerations, he's decided to have a child with Ayaka before Aoi and the others turn 20 and have children.

Today is Ayaka's last day temporarily suspending her work at the Men's Division.

She intends to dedicate herself to raising their child for a while.

Then, once Ayaka's child enters kindergarten, he plans to have a child with Tomoe.

This alternating arrangement with Ayaka and Tomoe ensures that one of them can always be Yuuta's supervising officer.

Once Tomoe is pregnant, Ayaka plans to return as Yuuta's supervising officer.


Upon hearing this, Yukishiro, while congratulating Ayaka and Yuuta, muttered something to herself.

It was something about wanting to do it before she gets pregnant...


Yukishiro has the help of Akari, the others, and Ririka, as well as Ririka's sister, Kayane.

And Saori will likely have the help of Akari's mother.

Yukishiro believes that even an inexperienced family head can manage with some basic advice from an experienced mother.



Once Yuuta turns 18, he will begin his sperm donation service.

As promised to the Prime Minister, he will provide his sperm to the country twice a month.

A semen test was conducted during his second-year health check-up, and Yuuta's sperm rank was A-rank.

However, Yuuta's sperm possesses a preciousness that cannot be expressed by the current ranking system, a fact known only to the administrators.

Even Yuuta himself is unaware of this.



While Yuuta is unaware of his sperm's preciousness, he did become aware of something else: the size of his penis.

After losing consciousness and waking up at the end of July last year, once his strength and health returned, his penis had somehow grown larger.

It seemed to be the same size as the penis in the memories of the old world's men he possesses.

There might be some connection, or it might just be a coincidence of his penis growing.

The truth is unknown, but his penis definitely grew larger.



Due to the increase in his penis size, problems arose with the shared sensation of the dildos.

Therefore, a free exchange was offered for the already released dildos.

It was a decision with significant potential losses, but they conveyed the situation accurately and transparently.



However...

None of the women opted for the free exchange.

They all bought the newly released, latest Yuuta-sized dildos.

Yuuta was moved, believing the women had chosen not to exchange them out of kindness, thinking how kind they all were.



However!

While Ayaka and Aoi didn't say anything to the moved Yuuta, the truth is different.

As women, Aoi and the others understand the feelings of the women of the world.

They wanted to keep the smaller Yuuta-sized dildos…

Having both the smaller and larger sizes allows them to feel Yuuta's growth.

Since the smaller dildo will no longer be produced, they can’t get another one ever again.  There’s no way they’d exchange them.

In fact, none of Aoi and her friends exchanged theirs.



Incidentally, the box Yukishiro gave Saori contained two dildos, one large and one small.



During Yuuta's semen test, which resulted in his A-rank, a compatibility test was conducted with a certain woman.

It wasn't a special test exclusively with Yuuta, as she herself had requested a compatibility test.

Compatibility tests with boys who haven't started sperm donation are not usually conducted, but because Yuuta had heard her request the test, he asked to be included.

The results showed that his compatibility with her was the best possible, and further genetic manipulation was deemed unnecessary.


The results were immediately conveyed to her.

Then, Yuuta contacted her and told her something.

He told her, "If you don't mind, I'd be happy if we could have a proper relationship, not just a business transaction."

Yuuta was truly happy that the woman, Suzune, happily accepted.



Suzune and her family have started a new life in Makuhari.

Suzune and her mother work as clerical staff at the Nymph Land, and Nagisa got a job at a Makuhari kindergarten.

As Yuuta's managed small special district grows, the day may come when Nagisa becomes a teacher for boys.



The Prime Minister, Nanase, and Saori also joined the discussion, and it was decided to establish a special district in the area, including Makuhari, under Yuuta's management.

Takashi and Sakurako rejoiced at Yuuta's proposal.

Sakurako, who had been prepared for the separation from Naoto-kun, was overwhelmed with joy and couldn't stop crying.

While Naoto-kun might not fully understand, he was happy knowing he could see his beloved parents whenever he wanted.

Takashi also rejoiced, slapping Yuuta on the back.


Besides Naoto-kun, four other boys and their mothers wished to live in this small special district.  The families, who expressed considerable anxiety about being separated from their sons, and those who prefer to be with their mothers rather than playing with friends, were carefully chosen by the government. Each family quickly agreed to live in the special district.

Like Naoto-kun, the boys don't fully understand the situation, but knowing they can see their mothers whenever they want, they immediately agreed.

The mothers also rejoiced at the chance to live in an environment where their sons could see them if they wanted and readily accepted the offer.


Yuuta's managed special district is not a world where mothers and children live together.

Elementary school-aged boys will live separately from their mothers, needing to grow into independent men.

If Naoto-kun and the others, as middle school, high school, and then married men, become so influenced by their mothers that they neglect their wives and lovers, this small world wouldn't be accepted by the women of the world.

That's not the world Yuuta wants to create.

In this distorted world with few men, he wants a place where mothers and sons, and the sons' wives and lovers, can all love each other.

With that goal in mind, Yuuta will continue working hard on the tasks before him.





Yuuta's male rank was upgraded to C-rank at the end of his second year.

Reaching C-rank before high school graduation is considered excellent.

It's expected that Yuuta will rise to B-rank like Takashi in the future, and even possibly A-rank someday.

However, this requires continued effort from Yuuta.

No matter his past achievements or the preciousness of his sperm (of which he's unaware), if the current Yuuta and the future Yuuta don't work hard, his male rank won't rise.

That's the way of this world.

Both men and women are constantly ranked.

It means they're constantly expected to strive for improvement.

Men strive for women, women strive for men, and both strive for society.



Amidst these efforts, many things will change.

Whether something that exists at this very moment will still exist tomorrow, a year later, ten years later, or a hundred years later is unknown.

To live is to change.  No matter where these changes lead, as long as we are alive, we are required to change.

And it is not someone else, but our own hearts that seek this change… Yuuta believes.


His relationship with Aoi, his relationship with Yukishiro, his relationships with everyone—they may not always go smoothly.

He is to become the husband of two long-standing prestigious families of Tokyo.

The changes awaiting him will be greater than those of any other man in this world.

Yuuta must accept and continue to strive.





God does not conveniently guide the world.

Whether God exists or not is unknown.

While he doesn't worship any particular god, he doesn't intend to deny their existence.

However, God would not exist for someone else's convenience.

Therefore, he will continue to strive.

For himself, for everyone he cherishes, and for society.


For the happy smile now beside him.



To all readers,

Thank you.
