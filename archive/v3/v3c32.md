Episode 32: Suzune ②
September 20th.

My retrial for the sexual assault case against Yuuta-sama was held today.

Everything I confessed and admitted in the trial four years ago is true.  However, there were things I didn't say then.

My mother and Nagisa were in the audience.

After meeting with Yuuta-sama, when I returned to prison, visits, previously denied, were suddenly permitted. My mother and Nagisa came to see me immediately, and cried when they saw me.  I told them about the possibility of a retrial.

I never expected the retrial to happen so quickly.  It seems Yuuta-sama’s strong desire was a major factor.  The retrial mainly involved Yuuta-sama recounting the events of that day.


Yuuta-sama described the events in detail: how he initiated the embrace by asking, "Shall we hug?" How I confirmed, "Can I really hug you?" and he nodded. How he felt happy, remembering his mother's kindness as I hugged him from behind. How my touch gradually became more intense. How he found it pleasurable. How he responded with a "yes" to my confirmation, "Is this alright?".


After Yuuta-sama’s testimony, I told the judge what I hadn't revealed four years ago: that I had misinterpreted his "yes" as enthusiastic consent, mistaking his arousal for acceptance of me. That when I asked him, "You were excited, weren't you?", he replied, "I don't really know, but Suzune-san is kind, like my mother," and that those words instantly calmed me. That he wasn't accepting me, but seeking his mother's kindness, and I had misunderstood.


Following my statement, Yuuta-sama spoke to the judge again. He explained why he sought his mother’s affection: the painful separation from his mother when he started elementary school, and his longing for her ever since. He stated that a child's need for a mother's love is natural.  Girls can live with their mothers even after starting elementary school, but boys... it's customary for boys to separate from their mothers when they begin elementary school.


This retrial wasn't about the dynamics between boys and their mothers. It was the retrial of *my* case.  Therefore, Yuuta-sama couldn't delve deeply into his relationship with his mother.


The retrial concluded in the morning. The prosecution and defense attorney were present but didn't speak.  Only Yuuta-sama and I spoke to the judge and jury. The verdict was to be delivered in the afternoon.  The fact that everything was concluded in a single day highlights the unusual nature of this retrial.


During the lunch break, we had lunch with Yuuta-sama and his party. It was unheard of for the victim and perpetrator to eat together.  Yuuta-sama himself invited us.


There, Yuuta-sama apologized to my mother, bowing his head. My mother and I were surprised, and quickly asked him to raise his head. Nagisa seemed incredibly shocked as well.


Nagisa was angry, knowing Yuuta-sama’s actions at the time of the incident. I had warned him not to say anything to Yuuta-sama, but seeing Yuuta-sama apologize with a bowed head, Nagisa couldn't bring herself to say anything.


During the lunch break, Yuuta-sama offered to support us in the future.  The afternoon's verdict would likely mean the end of my sentence.  Even though I'd been incarcerated for over four years, my sentence was expected to be four years.


I would be returning to Yokohama with my mother and Nagisa. I planned to find a new job in Yokohama, but my reputation had preceded me, and I was worried about finding employment.

Yuuta-sama suggested we move to Makuhari and work there.  Not just me, but my mother and Nagisa too. He offered to provide housing for me and my mother, and a home for Nagisa, as well as securing us jobs.


The jobs were at "Demon Land," a theme park under construction in Makuhari.  I didn't know what a "succubus suit" was, but my mother and Nagisa did. Nagisa apparently owned one, but stressed that she didn't use it. She muttered something about accidentally buying it, but I didn't understand.


"Demon Land" was scheduled to open in November, and they would hire us as administrative staff for the operating company, Yoshiwara's company—a huge corporation.


I thought it was an amazing opportunity, but I wanted to hear my mother and Nagisa's opinions, so we moved to a separate room.  They both wanted to accept the offer.  Life in Yokohama was becoming difficult... I'm sorry, it's all my fault.


Returning to Yuuta-sama, we told him we accepted his offer.  He smiled happily.  Truly... Yuuta-sama is not at fault, and he doesn't need to feel guilty towards me. But it would make me happy if this eased his burden, and it would certainly help us.



The afternoon session resumed. The verdict was read immediately. My sentence was four years—not life imprisonment.  Since I had already served that time, I was free.


My mother cried with joy at hearing the four-year sentence. Nagisa said she felt truly relieved for the first time after hearing the judge's decision.  Yuuta-sama seemed somewhat dissatisfied that his own actions weren't addressed.  He wouldn't face any charges for what happened, of course.


As we prepared to leave, Yuuta-sama asked to speak with me privately in a separate room.  Alone, he apologized to me again, bowing his head. I quickly apologized, bowing my head as well. My foolish actions had led me to commit a crime—that was a fact.


We both bowed deeply, which felt a little absurd.


After this exchange of apologies, Yuuta-sama, smiling, hesitantly asked me something.  He asked, once things settled down, if I planned to have children.


I said yes. I had been planning artificial insemination and still wanted to be a mother.  Pregnancy immediately after starting work at Demon Land would be difficult, so I thought in about three years.


I intended to have another compatibility test with the sperm, just in case.  I doubted anything would have changed, but I had lost weight in the past four years and needed to prepare my body for artificial insemination.  Yuuta-sama said it was okay if I waited until my body was ready, not necessarily three years.  He would also cover my salary during any period of leave. I was hesitant to accept such kindness, but Yuuta-sama insisted, so I gratefully accepted.



We were driven back to Yokohama in a Yoshiwara company car.  Yuuta-sama saw us off as we left the courthouse.  Someone from Yoshiwara would be coming to our house tomorrow to discuss future arrangements.


That night, we had dinner together at my mother's house, with Nagisa. It was incredibly delicious. My mother and Nagisa cried happy tears, smiling. They must have endured a difficult time since my imprisonment. Nagisa could have avoided hardship by severing ties with me, but she thought of me all along… I'm truly happy to be welcomed back by them.


I committed a crime.  That's an undeniable truth. I am a criminal.  For four years, I prayed for atonement to Yuuta-sama every day. And today, I have finished paying my debt and have been granted a new life.


I found myself crying as well. My mother and Nagisa were crying so much that I couldn't help but cry too.  The tears wouldn't stop.


Those four years were agonizing.  The guilt of hurting Yuuta-sama, my mother, and Nagisa was unbearable. The loneliness of being a sex offender against a man, unable to see anyone in prison, was painful. The pain was overwhelming, but as a foolish criminal, I didn't think I deserved to cry, so I suppressed my emotions. But the more I suppressed them, the stronger they became… I cried every night.


But these tears aren't painful.  These tears, shared with my mother and Nagisa, filled my heart with warmth.  Ah… I'm alive. I'm alive. How… how happy I am…
