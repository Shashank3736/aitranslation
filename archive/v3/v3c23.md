Episode 23: The Crying Princess ③

"Mother. It's Yukishiro."

"Come in."


As she had yesterday, Yukishiro entered her mother's room and stopped before the prepared chair.

"Sit down."

"Yes."


Following the same exchange as yesterday, Yukishiro sat, and Saori, seated opposite her, immediately got to the point.

"Today's meeting confirmed Yukishiro-san as Yuuta-sama's second wife and the next head of the Minato family. You no longer need to go to Yoshiwara."

"……I'm the *next* head of the Minato family. Mother is the current head."

"As I said at the meeting, you will assume the head's position immediately after marrying Yuuta-sama."

"Mother, please wait. As Kayane also said, there's no reason to rush the change of headship. Please, reconsider."

"As I said yesterday, I will assist with the head's duties until Yukishiro-san has a child and their upbringing is settled."


It seemed she had no intention of changing her mind.

There wasn't enough time to understand Saori's stubbornness.

With Yuuta's problem unresolved, they couldn't assume a change of headship.


"Mother… what I'm about to say… please keep it a secret, don't tell anyone."

"……What is it?"

"Right now… Yuuta-sama is having a problem."

"Yuuta-sama?"


At this confession from Yukishiro, Saori's expression reflected her anxiety.

*Could it be a repeat of Takuya's situation?* she momentarily thought, but immediately dismissed it as improbable.

If that were the case, Yukishiro wouldn't be so attached to Yuuta.


"Yuuta-sama… at the end of July, he fainted and collapsed."

"Wh-what…"

"Since then… he hasn't regained consciousness."

"No, no way!"

"He's alive!  The doctor's examination showed no physical problems!"

"No physical problems? Then why hasn't he regained consciousness?"

"That… I don't know."

"You don't know?"


Saori wouldn't understand this explanation.

But Yukishiro didn't understand either.

Why wasn't Yuuta waking up?


"Right now… I'm desperately searching for the cause.  There's a plan to… soon… possibly bring Yuuta-sama's consciousness back."

"What is it?"

"I can't give details…"


Tears welled up in Yukishiro's eyes.

Because it involved confronting Suzune, the criminal who sexually assaulted Yuuta.

If possible, she didn't want to do that.

However, there weren't many options left.

If this method failed to awaken Yuuta… she would have to resort to a far worse one.

Thinking about that, Yukishiro's tears wouldn't stop.


Yukishiro naturally began to tell her mother everything.

About the despair she felt last Christmas Eve when she was told about the marriage to a stranger.

About being saved by Yuuta and the others on New Year's Eve.

About how, for these eight months, she had lived supported by Yuuta's, Aoi's, and everyone's kindness.

And about being loved by Yuuta.

About the precious bond of love she would never forget.

About her beloved being unconscious.


Like a young child telling their mother about their day, Yukishiro, tears streaming down her face, confided in Saori.


"If Yuuta-sama… by any chance, doesn't wake up… I will stay by his side until I die, waiting for him to awaken."

"…"

"If Yuuta-sama… by any chance… *sniffle*… dies… I… I can't live…"

"…"

"In that case… Iori-san… if Iori-san can't… then Mother, as Iori-san's child's guardian and head of the family…"

"…Really?"

"Eh?"

"Really, Yukishiro, you've fallen in love with Yuuta, haven't you?"

"……Yes. I fell in love. It's hard to put this feeling into other words. It's something I can only feel and understand in my heart. This is love."

"So…"

"My foolish love was accepted by Yuuta-sama. And he loved me."

"…"

"Thanks to Mother, I can return to Minato. But right now… please let me go to Yuuta-sama's side. One day, I want to greet Yuuta-sama, when he wakes up… with Mother, in this mansion."


At Yukishiro's tearful words, Saori's eyes also filled with tears.

Yukishiro was surprised by her mother's unexpected tears.


"Ah… Yukishiro-san. That… is impossible."

"Impossible? Wh-why?! Yuuta-sama doesn't hate Mother at all!"

"It's not that… I… I… I am not a worthy person to stand before Yuuta-sama as a mother."

"Wh-what are you saying…? The strict education you gave me was, of course, necessary! I am grateful! Yuuta-sama is too!"

"It's not that! Ah… ah!!"


Yukishiro heard Saori's heartbroken sobs – a sound unlike anything she'd heard before.  Saori cried out without trying to restrain the sound, which could be heard outside the room.

Seeing her mother so distraught for the first time, Yukishiro stood up from her chair, went to Saori's side, and embraced her trembling body.

"Mother! Mother! Calm down."

"Ah! Ah! Why… why!"


The mother, embraced by her daughter, cried out.

The sorrow that no one understood.

The cursed suffering that no one could know.


"Haah… haah… haah… Yukishiro-san"

"Yes…"


How long did she cry?

Saori's body grew weak.


"Go to Yuuta's side. Stay by the side of Yuuta-sama, who gave you love, Yukishiro-san…"

"……Yes."

"Haah… haah… I'm alright now. Just… wait a little."


Saori stood up and went into the inner bedroom.

Yukishiro waited standing, and Saori quickly returned.

In her hand was a wooden box.


"Take this…."

"This is?"


Yukishiro held the box Saori gave her; it felt quite heavy.


"May I open it?"

"……Yes."


Yukishiro opened the box.

Inside… was a magnificent short sword.


"This! A short sword…"

"I… couldn't offer it."

"Eh?"

"It's sharpened by a craftsman every year. It's a fine weapon."


Yukishiro drew the short sword from its scabbard; the sharp blade reflected the light.


"Mother…"

"Prepare a short sword yourself to offer to Yuuta-sama. Think of it… as a charm. I would be happy if you kept it. From me… a mother who is disqualified…"

"Don't say you're disqualified. Mother is my precious mother! The harsh guidance was necessary, I understand!  Even that forceful engagement… I had to have a husband! I was a fool who couldn't bear the responsibility of being the next head and ran away! Now, it's just that I'm loved by Yuuta-sama…"


Neither Saori nor Yukishiro held a normal position in a noble family.

As an eternally established noble family, the burdens they had to bear were excessively heavy.

Although Yukishiro had endured the hardships Saori had inflicted on her, she didn't resent her.

Saori, despite her broken heart, had worked hard to serve as the head of the Minato family and guide her daughter.

She was her precious… beloved mother.


"Mother… please, please bless me and Yuuta-sama. And stay by our side, as the head of the Minato family."

"Yukishiro-san…"


Saori’s expression was still tormented even after hearing Yukishiro's heartfelt words.

The sorrow and pain that tormented Saori's heart.

The more she accepted Yukishiro’s words, the more it raged within her.


"I bless you… Mother… as a mother… I bless Yukishiro-san and Yuuta-sama."

"Mother… why are you so sad? What torments your heart?"

"It's alright. Yukishiro-san… it’s alright now. It’s all in the past. I can’t change anything anymore."

"Mo, Mother…"

"The clock's hands won't turn back. I… I… I was a woman who wasn't even allowed to offer a short sword… my feelings… that's all."


Looking at the clock decorating Saori's room, it was nearing the time Nanase would come to pick her up.


"Nanase-sama will be coming soon. Go prepare yourself in your room and wait."

"……Yes."

"If you find out anything about Yuuta-sama's condition, please contact me…"

"Yes. Of course."


Without waiting for Yukishiro to leave, Saori went into the bedroom.

Holding the wooden box containing the short sword from her mother, Yukishiro also left the room.


Iori and Ririka were outside.

They must have heard Saori's cries.

Yukishiro smiled calmly at Iori’s shaken face.


"I'm sorry for the commotion."

"No, a, a-about Mother…"

"She's resting in the bedroom."


Yukishiro glanced back at Saori's room.

Had her words reached Saori's heart?


(They weren't unheard. But I couldn't understand my mother's heart. Mother… what are you suffering from? Why are you so sad…)


"I'll wait in my room until Nanase-sama arrives."

"Yes…"








After Yukishiro left, Saori buried her face in the bed and cried.

She had cried uncontrollably in front of her daughter.

It was unbecoming of the head of the Minato family.


(Why… why… why…)


There was no one to answer that question.


(Yukishiro-san is my precious daughter… and so is Iori-san… yes… they are my daughters… my daughters!)


Words she had repeatedly told herself.

To keep her shattered heart from breaking apart.

That Yukishiro was her daughter.

That she was her precious daughter.


(It hurts… it hurts… it hurts so much… Ena… Ena… why did you leave me…)


Only Ena had known Saori's suffering and pain.

Saori had been able to maintain herself because Ena was there.


(It has to be Ena… no one else… ah… this pain… the pain that makes me want to disappear… I can't tell anyone…)


Akari's mother was trying to support Saori.

She understood it was for her daughter, but Saori was still grateful.

However, she couldn't replace Ena.

No one could.


(Forgive me… forgive me, Yukishiro-san. I… as a mother… I can't bear to see Yukishiro-san and Yuuta-sama together… my heart can’t take it…)


It was too painful for Saori to see Yukishiro and Yuuta in love.


She had allowed Iori and Katsuya to be together.

Even if they said they liked each other, a year ago they were still middle schoolers, which had kept Saori calm.

When the idea of Iori and Katsuya becoming a couple became realistic, Saori didn’t know how she’d feel.


And when Yukishiro interacted with Takuya, Saori could observe them.

Yukishiro interacted seriously with Takuya, but she wasn’t in love.

As a mother, she knew Yukishiro wasn’t in love with Takuya.

That's why she could watch calmly and meet Takuya.


But Yuuta was different.

Yukishiro was truly in love with Yuuta, and they loved each other.

Saori knew that Yuuta treated Yukishiro with kindness and love, and that was…


"Ugh… ugh… ahhhh!!"


If she didn't cry out her own sorrow, she couldn't protect her heart, which was about to crumble from the curse within her body.
