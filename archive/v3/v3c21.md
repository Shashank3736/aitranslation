Episode 21: Suzune ①

My wake-up time is 6:30 AM, but I wake up at 6:00 AM every morning to pray. I pray for Yuuta's peace and health, hoping he can heal from the hurt caused by my ugly heart.

After waking, I wash my face and clean my room. I'm incarcerated in the first ward of Kanagawa Prison, a maximum-security facility. The first ward houses those serving life sentences.  I received a life sentence for sexually assaulting Yuuta, a man.

It's rare for women to be incarcerated for crimes against men, because it's difficult to commit such acts against men living in men-only areas.  Foolishly, I assaulted Yuuta because I was chosen for a volunteer program.

At 7:00 AM, we're supposed to line up outside for the headcount, but I'm instructed to wait in my room.  After the headcount, breakfast is delivered to my room, where I eat it.  All cells in the first ward are solitary confinement. The breakfast delivered through a hole in the wall is meager; I haven’t confirmed it, but my portion is probably smaller than others. I'm the only inmate in this ward convicted of a crime against a man. My treatment is harsher than the other inmates, in many ways besides my food.

Prison work begins at 8:00 AM.  My tasks vary daily, and I work alone, another example of my harsh treatment.

Since being incarcerated in the first ward of Kanagawa Prison, I haven’t spoken to or seen anyone, though my every move is undoubtedly monitored by security cameras. The fact I don't line up for the headcount and work alone are likely forms of harassment.  Perhaps the other inmates in the first ward refused to work alongside someone who committed a crime against a man, but I don’t know.

Lunch is at 12:00 PM, but I’m told to return to my room by 12:30 PM.  I eat the small, cold lunch in my room and resume work at 1:00 PM. Work usually ends at 4:30 PM, but mine lasts until 5:00 PM.  I return to my room, eat my cold dinner, and end my day.

Lights out is at 9:00 PM, so I have free time from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM.  Shortly after my incarceration, I tried to go to the common room with the TV, but a guard scolded me, and I haven’t left my room since. I wasn't assaulted, but I felt like I would be if I continued to leave my room.

Bathing is allowed three times a week in winter and four times in summer.  I must bathe between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, and the unspoken rule is that I have only a 10-minute bath slot at 7:50 PM.

This solitary existence is incredibly painful.  Without letters from my mother and Nagisa, I would have lost my mind long ago.  I'm allowed one letter per week from them. My replies are limited to one per month, and their content is checked by the guards before being sent.

Despite this hardship, something wonderful happened.  Mother and Nagisa's letter informed me that Yuuta became engaged to Aoi, the heir to the Yoshiwara Eitaimeika family. The court heard Yuuta was deeply hurt by my actions and unable to leave his room.  I pray for his healing every morning and night, and learning of his engagement with Aoi brought me immense joy.


I was a kindergarten teacher. I took a leave of absence for artificial insemination and underwent genetic modification, which was successful. While hospitalized, Nagisa visited, and just as she was leaving, my tablet buzzed, even though it was on silent mode. After Nagisa left, I checked and saw that Yuuta had accepted my volunteer request.  The notification always sounds, even on silent mode, when a volunteer request is accepted.

The body modification program, including the artificial insemination, was to start in two weeks.  Yuuta wanted to volunteer within a week, and we ended up playing a game together on April 10th, four days later.


That day, while playing the game with Yuuta, I foolishly let my lust run wild and sexually assaulted him. I touched his body until the police arrived and arrested me.  The room was of course monitored, what a fool I was!  Or rather, it wasn't the monitoring, but the fact that I touched Yuuta's body like that… I'm irredeemably foolish.

In the courtroom, I heard my mother's cries. Nagisa defended me to the end.  But I'm a criminal, a sexual offender against a man.  Not only did I suffer, but my mother received cruel words from the public and must have been in pain. Nagisa… even though I told her repeatedly to cut ties with me, she still sends me letters.


Another day like any other. I'll spend the rest of my life praying for Yuuta. One day, something unusual happened. While working alone, a guard – a different one than I’d seen before – came to me. When was the last time I saw someone’s face?


"Number 145, you have a visitor."

"What?"

A visitor? For me?  Why? They’d been preventing visitors.

Even I, with a life sentence, have visitation rights.  Mother and Nagisa’s letters mentioned that they'd been denied visits under various pretexts. I once asked a guard about visits, but they said that due to the nature of my crime – against a man – visits were not permitted for the time being.  When they cited the gravity of my crime against Yuuta, I had nothing to say.  That's why I thought I’d never see Mother or Nagisa again until I died.


"Is it… my mother?"

Was the visitor my mother or Nagisa?

"Just come with me. This is an order from above. It's none of my business."

"Y-yes…"

The guard seemed very irritated.  I stopped my work and followed him.  For the first time since arriving at this prison, I walked through the administration area and arrived at the visiting room.


"Don't say anything unnecessary.  Go in."

"Y-yes."

The door opened.  My heart pounded.  I was overjoyed to see Mother and Nagisa!  But then I saw someone completely unexpected.


"What…"


I'll never forget it. Through the glass of the visiting room sat Tomoe, Yuuta's case officer. The other woman was unfamiliar, but she was likely also from the men's division, like Tomoe.


"It's been a while… Suzune-san."

"Y-yes."

Why?  A visit? From Tomoe?


"Please have a seat."

"…Yes."

My mind was racing, but I sat down.  The door to the visiting room closed.


Tomoe, with her blonde hair, fair skin, and blue eyes; her father was from Sasharl Kingdom, if I recall correctly. Her features are quite different from Japanese women.  She was the officer who glared at me with hatred that day and protected Yuuta.


"I'm sorry for the surprise visit."

"N-no."

"You've… lost weight."

"Y-yes, that’s true…"

Not just a little. Compared to then, I've lost a lot of weight, looking quite shabby.  Was she here to check if I’m properly atoning for my crime?

"I’m spending my days of atonement quietly here. I cannot be forgiven, but I pray daily for Yuuta’s peace and well-being, hoping his heart will find some solace and he will be healthy."

"Yes… I've read your reports…"

Good.  The guards didn’t tamper with my reports.  It's not something confined within the prison walls, so they must have written it honestly.


"T-the letter exchange is permitted… my mother and my best friend… told me that Yuuta got engaged."

"…He became engaged to Aoi-sama, the heir to the Yoshiwara Eitaimeika family, in May."

"I shouldn’t say this, but… congratulations.  Knowing that Yuuta is doing well made me so happy."


I was truly happy when I learned from my mother and Nagisa’s letter, but speaking with Tomoe, the case officer, made me even happier.  It's truly wonderful that Yuuta, who was hurt because of me, is now happy.


"The letter exchange is allowed… but what about regular visits?"

"I’m… a criminal, a perpetrator of a crime against a man.  I haven’t been granted visitation rights yet."

"What? R-really…"

Four years have passed since the incident.  It's unusual for visitation rights to be denied for this long. But that’s fine; it’s part of my atonement.


“…”

"A-and… why are you here today?"

Tomoe didn't come here just to chat with me.  I'm also curious about the other woman who hasn’t spoken yet.


Tomoe seems hesitant, lost in thought. What is it? She surely hates me more than anyone; after all, I hurt someone under her care.


If Tomoe yells at me, I'll accept it. Even though it was four years ago, my crime will never disappear.


"Tomoe-san…"


The other woman speaks to Tomoe. Her voice is calm and kind.


"Suzune-san…"

"Y-yes."

"I have a request. That’s why I’m here today."

"A request?  F-for me?"

A request? What is it?


"That incident…"

"…Yes."

"Everything you confessed in court… was it all true?"

Why are they asking now…?


"…Yes. Everything is true."

"I played a game with Yuuta, lusted after kind Yuuta… and touched his body without resistance, committing the crime."

"…Yes. There's no mistake."


That’s right… my foolish self, I made a mistake.


"Ugh…"

"Tomoe-san…"


Are they re-investigating the incident?  But why? The trial is over, and I’m serving a life sentence.


"As an exception… a special case, with permission from the Prime Minister of Japan, we have a request for you, Suzune-san."

"Y-yes."

"We want you to… meet with Yuuta."

"…What?"


Meet Yuuta?  What? Me?


"W-why!?"


I don't understand.  Why would I meet with Yuuta?


"Isn't Yuuta asking for this?"

"N-no, it's not like that."


I truly don't understand. What are you saying? Why?


"Why, if Yuuta doesn't want to see me?"

"I can’t explain that either."

"Suzune-san."

"Y-yes."


The other woman speaks to me.


"I'm Ayaka, also from the men's division, like Tomoe.  I'm sorry for not properly greeting you, even though it’s our first meeting."

"N-no."

"What Tomoe is saying… that's all she can say right now."

"B-but…"

"It’s bound to be confusing for you, Suzune-san. But please believe this: we want you to meet Yuuta for his sake."

"For Yuuta’s… sake?"

"Yes.  For Yuuta's sake.  Meeting Yuuta might not change anything, but it might change everything."

"What do you mean?"


I really don’t understand anymore.  But Ayaka's expression is serious, and so is Tomoe’s.


"Suzune-san… if you want to atone for what you did to Yuuta… please, don’t say anything. Just come with us."
