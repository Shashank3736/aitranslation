Episode 25: The Sleeping Prince (10)

The time is 8 PM.

Suzune, riding in a car with Nanae, gets out after less than 10 minutes.  Lilith's research facility is very close.

Manami is waiting at the entrance.  Even the usually composed Manami cannot hide her distress at seeing Suzune.  She's the woman who hurt the man she devoted her body and soul to.  Under normal circumstances, she would never allow Suzune near Yuuta.

"Nanae-sama," Manami says.

"What is it?" Nanae replies.

"Reira-san is in Yuuta-sama's room."

"Reira-san? Why?"

Reira's presence is unavoidable.  But she shouldn't be allowed into the research facility.

"Lira-sama said to let Reira-san in tonight."

"You mean, to have her witness this?"

"Yes... there was some argument, but Lilith-sama also permitted it, so we had no choice but to let her in."

"Then, I suppose it can't be helped."

Suzune doesn't want Reira near Yuuta, but now isn't the time to worry about that.

"Suzune-san," Manami says.

"Y-yes!" Suzune replies.

"There are others besides us who will be present in Yuuta-sama's room. But Suzune-san, please don't mind them and follow Lilith-sama's instructions."

"Yes..."

They arrive at the innermost room. Manami uses a card key to open the door.

"We've been expecting you."

Lilith, wearing a hood, greets Suzune, who was brought by Nanae.

"I am Lilith, the director of this facility."

"S-Suzune," Suzune stammers.

"Please, this way."

Lilith guides Suzune to the center of the room. Two women are standing there: Aoi and Yukishiro.  Suzune doesn't know their faces, but she guesses the one who somewhat resembles Nanae is Aoi.  She wouldn't know that the other woman is Yukishiro, the heir to the Minato Eita family.

Besides those two, there are two more women by the wall: Reira and Moe. Reira, though permitted entry, is being watched by Moe.

Another woman, wearing a hood similar to Lilith's, is also present.  Lira watches the proceedings with interest.

"Aoi-sama, is it alright?" Lilith asks.

"...Yes," Aoi replies.

The woman Suzune thought resembled Nanae is indeed Aoi.  Aoi's eyes show intense distress, as do Yukishiro's.

Yuuta is asleep on the bed behind them. Aoi and Yukishiro move to Yuuta's left side. Lilith leads Suzune to Yuuta's right.

"You know the situation?" Lilith asks.

"...Yes." Suzune replies.

"Then let's begin. Please try calling out to Yuuta-sama.  Let's start by having you call his name."

"...Yes."

Aoi and Yukishiro's gazes are fixed on Suzune from across Yuuta. Feeling their stares, Suzune looks at Yuuta's sleeping face.

(Oh... Yuuta-sama... you've grown...)

This is their first meeting since that incident.  Back then, Yuuta had just turned 13.  Suzune remembers a still somewhat childish Yuuta, and now sees a grown young man.


"Y-Yuuta-sama," Suzune whispers, calling his name timidly, her voice trembling.

"Please, a little louder," Lilith instructs.

"...Yuuta-sama," Suzune calls again, clearly and more loudly.  A slight reaction is visible on the monitoring equipment that Lilith and Lira are watching.

"There seems to be a reaction."

However, the reaction is similar to the one they got when Aoi and Yukishiro called out to him.

"Besides his name… could you say something else to Yuuta-sama?  Perhaps… about that incident?"

At Lilith's words, Aoi bites her lip.  The grip on Yukishiro's hand tightens. They desperately suppress their emotions, watching Yuuta intently for any sign of a change.

"Yuuta-sama… it's Suzune. Four years ago… I received a service request from Yuuta-sama. It was your first service activity. I was fortunate enough to play games with Yuuta-sama… I was very happy."

Suzune confesses her guilt in front of Yuuta's fiancee and lovers. This confession is unwanted by both Suzune and Aoi.

"I… I foolishly hurt Yuuta-sama.  It's not something that can be forgiven with an apology. But I am truly, truly sorry."

"...Please continue."

Yuuta's reaction continues.

"In prison… through letters from my mother and friends, I learned that Yuuta-sama… had become engaged to Aoi-sama. …I was happy.  Knowing that Yuuta-sama was living healthily and happily…"

Yuuta's reaction is different from when Aoi and the others spoke. With every sound from the machine indicating Yuuta's reaction, tension and anticipation build.

"Today… hearing about Yuuta-sama, I was very surprised.  That Yuuta-sama had collapsed… My… my foolish actions… Yuuta-sama's headaches… ugh…"

Suzune's voice trembles, and tears stream down her face.

"It was all my fault. At that time… at that time… why did I…"

Suzune's sobs make it impossible for her to continue.  Even though her words stop, the sounds indicating Yuuta's reaction continue, and the various readings on the machines are fluctuating wildly. But...

"It's no use… There was a reaction. But… he doesn't seem to be waking up."

"No…"

Despair spreads among Aoi and the others who had hoped for a reaction from the machine.  He doesn't wake up.  Even with Suzune's presence and a reaction, he doesn't regain consciousness.  Everyone in the room except one is filled with despair.

The one who isn't despairing is Reira.  She rejoices that if Yuuta doesn't wake up, she can take him to the Meer Kingdom.  Realistically, Reira won't be going to Meer Kingdom with Yuuta, but still, it increases her options compared to the current situation.


"Suzune-san, thank you," Lilith says.

"Oh, um…" Suzune replies.

"As you may have been told beforehand, nothing will happen to Suzune-san if Yuuta-sama doesn't wake up.  This method was only considered as one possibility."

"Yuuta-sama…" Suzune worries.

"I've done everything I could. Since he still doesn't wake up… the likelihood of him remaining unconscious is high."

"No way!"

"Next, we could take Yuuta-sama to the Meer Kingdom and have Lira-sama there examine him…"

Lilith looks at Aoi and Yukishiro.  Whether or not they take Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom is up to them.

"Taking him is fine, but even if I examine him, I can't guarantee he'll wake up," Lira states.

Reira is irritated by Lira's comment.  She mentally tells Lira to stop interfering.

"Still, we might be able to find out what the cause is," Lilith says.

Reira is pleased. That's good enough.

Moe, watching Reira, sees the change in her expression. She glares at Reira's ecstatic look of possibly being able to take Yuuta to the Meer Kingdom.

"Uu… Yuuta-sama… uu…"

Tears stream down Aoi's face as she stands before Yuuta, holding Yukishiro's hand. How many times has she cried since Yuuta collapsed?

The stability she once felt thanks to Yuuta is severely shaken. She absolutely doesn't want to take him to the Meer Kingdom, yet she must make that decision for Yuuta's sake.  Once she decides, she'll have to inform Her Majesty, the Queen of the Meer Kingdom. There's no turning back.

It's hard.  Her heart aches.  She can't rely on anyone, nor does she want anyone to decide for her. But she doesn't want to reach for any available method.

"Aaah… aaah… aaah!!!"

Aoi cries out, clinging to the sleeping Yuuta.  Yukishiro hugs Aoi tightly, holding her close to prevent her heart from breaking.

"Yuuta-sama…"

Watching Aoi's outburst, Suzune looks at Yuuta, who remains unconscious. Yuuta's reactions, as shown on the machine, continue.  His reactions even intensify as Aoi clings to him. Still, he doesn't wake up.

"Yuuta-sama…"

Suzune takes a step closer to Yuuta, remembering what happened that day.

"I… I…"

Suzune speaks to Yuuta again.

"I don't hate you… I don't hate Yuuta-sama!"

Suzune's words—that she doesn't hate him—leave everyone questioning. Why wouldn't she hate Yuuta, when he was the one who was wronged?

"It was my fault! Yuuta-sama… Yuuta-sama is not to blame! I misunderstood Yuuta-sama's heart!  It's true that I committed a crime! It's not Yuuta-sama's fault!"

No one understands what she's saying. Even Aoi, who had been sobbing and clinging to Yuuta, looks up, surprised by Suzune's incomprehensible words.

"I am the one who should be judged! It's not Yuuta-sama's fault!  Yuuta-sama… Yuuta-sama… ugh… because I was foolish… Yuuta-sama… Yuuta-sama… only wanted kindness! I misunderstood! Ahh, aaah!"

Considering only Suzune's words, did anything happen for Yuuta to be hated by Suzune? What did Yuuta, the victim, do?

Amidst her unstoppable sobs, Suzune earnestly prays.

"Please, please wake up!  Knowing that Yuuta-sama… Yuuta-sama was living happily, that's what made me happy too. Please… please…"

The readings on the machine are moving abnormally high.

"This is dangerous," Lira murmurs.

But Lilith doesn't stop her.  The machine's readings show danger, but Yuuta's visible reaction doesn't reflect that.

"Yuuta-sama… Yuuta-sama…"

Aoi whispers Yuuta's name near his ear, continuing Suzune's words.

"Yuuta-sama, Yuuta-sama!"

Yukishiro cries out.  Manami follows, calling Yuuta's name.

"Yuuta-sama!"

Tomoe, Ayaka, and Moe also call out Yuuta's name forcefully.

Then…

"Ah,"

Aoi, who was touching Yuuta, is the first to notice.  Yuuta's body moved.

"Just now… he moved… ah,"

His shoulder twitched. Yukishiro gently grasps Yuuta's left hand.

"Ha! His hand… there's strength in his hand… Yuuta-sama!"

Yuuta's neck moves, and his face turns to the left.  Slowly, his eyelids open… and he meets Aoi's tear-swollen eyes.
