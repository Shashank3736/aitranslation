October 15th.

It's the departure day for Yuta's class's school trip.

Their destination is "Demon Land," a theme park near Tokyo, which they have the place to themselves before its official opening.

Considering Yuta's health, the trip is only one night.

A hotel has been built right in front of Demon Land, and they'll be staying there.

Today and tomorrow, they'll play to their hearts' content at Demon Land.


The sight of all the girls in their succubus suits is breathtaking.

Yuta walks through Demon Land with the girls, all wearing tight-fitting black bodysuits.

This is Yuta's first time seeing Demon Land, and he's excited to see how his ideas have been realized.


Demon Land is a theme park based on demons, but it incorporates demonic elements while still offering normal amusement park rides and facilities.

Not all attractions involve explicit sexual content.  There are thrilling rides without any such elements, and even a space for enjoying a musical performance.


As a bonus, visitors can download memory data unique to Demon Land after enjoying the attractions.

Since all the girls in the class are wearing Yuta's exclusive succubus suits, the memory data from common attractions is Yuta's.  If they were wearing Kei's succubus suit, they'd get Kei's memory data.


Of course, there are also explicit attractions.

One ride involves traveling through a demon-themed space while listening to Yuta's voice guidance, with various caresses enjoyed along the way, facilitated by memory data downloaded to the succubus suits beforehand.

In a mystery-solving mansion, players progress while enduring Yuta's playful sexual antics.  A coffee cup ride allows interaction with a life-size Yuta robot, downloading more explicit memory data.

The park is full of inventive ways to have fun.


Yuta takes turns exploring the park with the girls in his class.

He's seen Ayaka and Tomoe in their succubus suits before, but seeing all the girls in theirs is a completely new and incredibly stimulating experience.


The girls are equally excited to see Yuta.

He's dressed as Yuta the demon.

The real Yuta the demon.

It's a little, no, quite embarrassing, but the girls are overjoyed, making Yuta happy too.


For this school trip, there is unique data hidden somewhere in Demon Land for all the girls in the class and Tomoe.  They all enjoy searching for it within the park.



After a fun day at Demon Land, Yuta and the girls head to the hotel in the evening.

After dinner, Yuta asks Aoi, Yukishiro, Manami, Akari, and Moe to come to his room later.


When Aoi and the others enter Yuta's room, they find unexpected guests: Ayaka and Tomoe, both looking worried.


"Ayaka-san, why are you here?"
"Actually, Yuta-sama summoned me, and I just arrived."


Ayaka's voice is stiffer than usual.  She, like Tomoe, has a serious expression.  This kind of expression towards Yuta is unusual.


"What's wrong?"


Yukishiro is also confused by Ayaka and Tomoe's atmosphere.


"Please, everyone, have a seat. I need to explain something."
"Yuta-sama, let's stop this. This is too dangerous."
'Dangerous?'


Aoi and the others immediately react to Tomoe's words.


"I want to talk to everyone and hear your opinions. That's why I gathered you."


After everyone sits down, Yuta stands up and begins to speak.


"Demon Land was fun, wasn't it? I'm looking forward to the opening. Let's all have fun at Demon Land tomorrow too. Now... about the trip back, there's somewhere I'd like to stop by."
"Stop by?"
"Kisarazu."


Kisarazu is a coastal region about an hour away.


"Why do you want to go to Kisarazu?"
"Takuya and his classmates are on a school trip in Kisarazu."
'What?!'


Aoi and the others are surprised.

First, the mention of Takuya's name.

And the fact that Takuya and his classmates are on a school trip in Kisarazu.


Kisarazu isn't particularly a tourist destination.  In the summer, they might go to a nearby beach, but it's October now. It's too late for swimming.


"Yukishiro-san"
"Y-yes?"
"I'm thinking of going to see Takuya in Kisarazu."
"W-why?"
"To hear about your father."
"Th-that!"


Last August, Takuya unexpectedly visited Yukishiro's father. To learn about the lifestyle and thoughts of the husband of the head of the Minato family.  As a result, access to Yukishiro's father's secluded summer villa was strictly controlled to prevent unexpected visitors.


Saori doesn't allow Yukishiro to see her father.  Yukishiro wants to know what kind of person her father is.  Yuta's idea is to learn about him from Takuya.

Upon hearing Yuta's plan, Yukishiro anxiously says:


"Yuta-sama, thank you for considering my worries.  But I didn't intend to hear from Takuya-sama."
"I understand how you feel, Yukishiro-san. But regarding Saori-san, Takuya is the only one who can provide information about your father right now."
"That's true, but..."
"I intend to ask Takuya if he said anything about what kind of person your father was, or his relationship with Saori-san.  If you have anything else you'd like to ask, please tell me."
"Surely, you don't intend to go see Takuya-sama alone, Yuta-sama?"
"No. I'm not planning to go alone. But I don't intend to bring Yukishiro-san along. It would be painful for her, and I wouldn't like it either."
"If I'm with Yuta-sama, then I will!"
"I'm very grateful for your feelings. But if Yukishiro-san comes along, it might... Takuya-kun won't be happy about that."
"Is Tomoe-neesan saying it's dangerous to meet Takuya-sama?"
"That's..."


Before Tomoe can answer Aoi's question, Yuta continues:


"It seems Takuya and his classmates don't have much money, and that's why their school trip is in Kisarazu."
"They don't have much money?"
"Because trading ships from the Meer Kingdom enter and leave Kisarazu's port, there's a special district in Kisarazu with a Meer Kingdom consulate. They're on a school trip in a hotel within this special district because they lack funds."


Aoi and the others wonder why Yuta knows so much about Takuya's class's financial situation and activities.  It's information they could find out if they wanted to, but information about Takuya is worthless to them.


"I'm planning to negotiate with Takuya by offering him money in exchange for information about Yukishiro-san's father.  But... it seems Layla is also on this school trip."
'!'
"While I was unconscious, she served as a caretaker for the royal members of the Meer Kingdom's delegation, but they've returned to Meer. Now she's in Kisarazu's Meer Kingdom special district with Takuya's class.  Emily and Monica are there too."
"No! Yuta-sama mustn't go!"


Following Aoi's words, Yukishiro, Manami, Moe, and Akari also object.  They can't let Yuta go where Layla is.


"If Yuta-sama absolutely must talk to Takuya-sama, we should arrange a different place to prevent Layla-san from contacting Yuta-sama. We will arrange the place."
"I understand what Aoi-san is saying, and I know everyone is worried.  The reason I'm approaching the place where Layla-san is, is because of my own circumstances."
"Yuta-sama's circumstances?"
"Yes.  Actually... I received a request for cooperation from someone, to contact them if Layla approaches me."
"What? ...What do you mean?"
"I can't reveal the client's name... but I'm hoping to gain favor with them through this cooperation."


The client is the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister's envoy is Hanasaki, Takuya's handler.  Yuta has met Hanasaki once and has been in contact with him several times since.

Initially, Yuta asked Hanasaki to get information about Yukishiro's father in exchange for giving Takuya money. He tried to get information through Hanasaki instead of meeting Takuya directly.  Then, Hanasaki suggested meeting Takuya directly on this school trip. He also informed Yuta about Layla being there.

Hanasaki told Yuta he only needed to talk to Takuya in Kisarazu, and that the Japanese government would ensure his safety.


"The only danger will be Layla. Emily and Monica aren't interested in me.  I won't contact Layla. I'll just talk to Takuya and return. I won't let Layla into the room where I talk to Takuya. I thought I'd have Tomoe-san and Ayaka-san as bodyguards.  As for Aoi-san and the others... Takuya dislikes you..."


Takuya dislikes Aoi and Manami for embarrassing him on his last day of middle school.  Aoi and the others understand this better than anyone.


"I know I'm causing you all to worry. I'm sorry for being selfish."


Since it's for Yuta's reasons, Aoi and the others can't just say no.  They want to fulfill Yuta's wishes as much as possible. However, if Yuta's safety is at risk, they must eliminate that danger.


"I'll send bodyguards from Yoshiwara immediately."
"The same from Minato."


For Aoi and Yukishiro, it's a natural response. However...


"I'm sorry.  I'd prefer not to have them."
"W-why?"
"At the client's request. However, the client will be deploying people to ensure my safety."


The ones protecting Yuta will be Japan's bodyguard unit.  Since Hanasaki said the Japanese government would protect Yuta's safety, there's no need for bodyguards from Yoshiwara and Minato.  Yuta thinks that having bodyguards from Yoshiwara and Minato, who can't communicate with the Japanese government, enter Kisarazu might cause alarm and hinder the Japanese government's goals.


The Japanese government's target isn't Layla.  Layla isn't that important.  But Layla could be useful for achieving the government's goals.


(They're using me as bait, hoping Layla will act recklessly...)


Yuta thinks Hanasaki's suggestion is too perfect. After contacting Hanasaki through Ayaka and proposing to pay Takuya for information about Yukishiro's father, Hanasaki suggested meeting Takuya in Kisarazu.  He probably manipulated the situation so Takuya's school trip would be in Kisarazu to enable this meeting.  He must have something planned in Kisarazu's port.


(Trading ships from the Meer Kingdom enter and leave Kisarazu's port. If Hanasaki deliberately directed the school trip to Kisarazu, his target is the trading ships? Well, I don't need to worry too much about the government's intentions.  I just need to meet Takuya and ask what I need to ask.)


"I can't tell you who the client is right now... but please understand that there's no one more trustworthy in Japan..."


From this statement, it's possible to guess who made the request to Yuta.  Aoi and Yukishiro correctly understood Yuta's words, deducing that the client is a high-ranking government official, possibly the Prime Minister.


"The client is promising Yuta-sama's safety, correct?"
"Yes, that's right."
"The content of the cooperation is to contact them if Layla-san approaches Yuta-sama. However, it's impossible for Layla-san to approach Yuta-sama now.  So, by Yuta-sama intentionally approaching Layla-san, you aim to create a situation that fulfills the cooperation request and thus gain favor with the client, right?"
"That's right."
"There's nothing dangerous that Yuta-sama himself has to do for the cooperation, right?"
"No. I'm not hiding anything. I'll only meet Takuya-kun in Kisarazu and talk to him. I won't take any other actions."
"...Understood."


And so, Yuta will go to see Takuya on the way back from the school trip.
