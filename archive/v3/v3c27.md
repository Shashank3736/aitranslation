Episode 27: The Awakened Prince

Yuuta's eyes slowly opened, meeting Aoi's tear-streaked face.


"…"


He couldn't speak.  Even trying to say, "Aoi-san," he couldn't find his voice.


"Yuuta-sama!"


Aoi hugged him.  Her familiar scent calmed him.  Why was she crying? Where was he?


"Oh, Yuuta-sama…"


Next, he saw Yukishiro, also in tears.


"…"


Again, he struggled to speak.


"It's alright that you can't speak yet, Yuuta-sama. You were unconscious for a long time,"


Yukishiro said.  Yuuta's memories began to return.  He remembered watching fireworks at a class trip.  There, he'd seen Naoto… and that brought back memories of starting elementary school.


(I was dreaming… dreaming of my mother… living with my mother.)


He'd lived with his kind mother.  He'd cried terribly when he had to leave her to start elementary school.  He'd snuck out of the bathroom window to see her again.  Then…


(I… I was trying to rely on Suzune…)


"Yuuta-sama…"
"…Su… Suz…"


Turning his head to the right, he saw a woman crying.  Her face, her voice… she strongly resembled his kind mother, though she looked thinner.


"Yes… it's Suzune."
"A… a…"


Suzune had hugged him from behind during volunteer work.  Overwhelmed, she'd touched his body.  It was unacceptable, a crime.  But Yuuta had been aroused by her touch.  Suzune, sensing his arousal, thought her actions were permitted.


Suzune had planned to undergo artificial insemination.  But if she were to be with this boy, this 13-year-old… the thought sent a wave of heat through her, her rationality crumbling under excitement.  She'd fantasized about sex with a man countless times in romance novels and games.


Even as an ordinary citizen, she thought, if she offered to not be a wife or girlfriend, she could probably have sex.  These kinds of transactions were often depicted in novels and games, and discussed in girls' anonymous online forums.


But it was different.  When asked why he was aroused, Yuuta had replied, "Because you're kind, like my mother."


Suzune froze.  Her mind went blank.  Had Yuuta embraced her because he desired her?


The next thing he knew, he was being restrained by police officers.


"I'm so glad you're awake…"
"Su… Suzune-san… I…"
"Don't say anything.  Don't…"


Yuuta's voice was slowly returning.  But his body was weak.  Yukishiro's words, "You were unconscious for a long time," suggested he'd been bedridden.


"Aoi-san… Yukishiro-san…"
"Sniff… yes…"
"Could you… help me sit up?"


Aoi and Yukishiro supported him from both sides, slowly raising him.  He looked around – he was in a completely unfamiliar place.  He drank some water Manami had given him, soothing his throat.


"Where are we?"
"My laboratory."


He looked towards the voice and saw Riris, her face covered by a hood.  Next to her was another hooded woman, resembling Riris.


"Riris-san…"
"I examined Yuuta-sama, who had been unconscious."
"How long…?"
"About two weeks, you were unconscious."
"Two weeks…"


Yuuta looked around the room, noticing Moe, Ayaka, Tomoe, and even Nanase. And then…


(Why is Leila here?)


He saw Leila standing by the wall, seemingly watched by Moe,  looking regretful.


"Tomoe-san…"
"Yes!"
"I need… cough, cough…"
"Don't push yourself!"
"Cough. I… I need to talk now."


Yuuta bowed deeply to Suzune, who looked worried.


"Suzune-san, I'm sorry."
"Yuuta-sama! No! No! It was my fault!"
"I… I also need to say something… but I… I was scared and ran away. I'm a coward."
"Yuuta-sama…"
"Everyone… please listen."


Yuuta took several deep breaths.


"I… during my first volunteer work in junior high… I played a game with Suzune-san."


Everyone listened intently to Yuuta's confession.


"Tomoe-san… I remembered clearly."
"Remembered…?"
"Yes.  I remembered what I learned in elementary school – that it's better to accept volunteer requests from prominent families.  I remembered that clearly and chose Suzune-san's request.  Suzune-san…"


Yuuta looked at Suzune again. Four years had passed, and she was thinner than before.  But she still resembled his mother.


"Suzune-san… you looked like my mother."
"Like Yuuta-sama's mother?"
"Yes… I'd always wanted to see my mother…"


Tomoe recalled Yuuta's childhood reports.  After separating from his mother, he'd sobbed uncontrollably, breaking free from the caregivers to chase after her.  Because direct goodbyes were too painful, boys were often moved to a new room while sleeping, and greeted kindly by caregivers upon waking.  But Yuuta's mother had chosen to say goodbye directly.  Until the very last second, she stayed with her beloved child.


"I… when I was in sixth grade… on the day I was allowed outside for an exchange event with girls… I escaped through the bathroom window."
"Ah…"


Tomoe remembered that report too.  But it said he’d escaped because he was scared of interacting with girls.


"I escaped because I wanted to see my mother. To her old house… even though I didn't know how to get there. I was quickly found… and I was afraid of being scolded, so I kept quiet. Everyone assumed I’d escaped because I was anxious about interacting with the girls…"


It seemed the caregivers had misinterpreted the situation. They probably couldn't harshly question a young Yuuta. It was his first time interacting with girls his own age. The caregivers assumed he was just anxious.


"In junior high, Tomoe-san said… 'Let's think about volunteer work when you're more settled,' but I… I wanted to see Suzune-san, who resembled my mother, so I accepted her request."
"Yuuta-sama… you attended school and had your health check-ups promptly… we thought you were doing incredibly well. Therefore… when we learned that your first volunteer work partner was Suzune-san, a civilian… and since Suzune-san's background was impeccable… we decided to watch over you, Yuuta-sama…"


And then the incident happened.  Yuuta continued his confession.


"It was me. I… I asked Suzune-san if we could hug."
"Because I talked about romance novels… about the longing couples have to embrace each other…"
"But I was the one who initiated it. Suzune-san, aside from her appearance, was truly a kind woman like my mother… we quickly became close, right?"
"…Yes."
"It was really fun playing games with Suzune-san."
"It was fun for me too…"
"I wanted to rely on Suzune-san. Like I used to rely on my mother…"


The incident had started with Yuuta's invitation.


"So, Yuuta-sama and Suzune-san hugged?"
"Yes… but afterwards… I did commit a crime.  Hugging Yuuta-sama… I… I got excited. I touched Yuuta-sama’s body."
"When you touched me, I was surprised at first. I wondered why you were touching me. But… I didn't mind being touched by Suzune-san. So… my body reacted."
"Your body reacted…"
"Yes. Back then, I didn't know much about sex, so I didn't fully understand my own situation. But now I do. I was aroused. And then, Suzune-san asked me, 'Is it okay?'  And I said, 'Yes.'"
"…I misunderstood. I thought it was alright."
"Misunderstanding…?"


Aoi interjected.  It wasn't a misunderstanding; perhaps Yuuta hadn't given permission.


"Yes. A misunderstanding. As Yuuta-sama said, he was still young and didn't have a good understanding of sex. So, even though he said 'yes', it wasn't a response based on a full understanding of its implications.  Because after that, Yuuta-sama said… 'I don't understand completely, but Suzune-san is kind, like my mother.'"
"…I didn't mind it. Really.  I didn't mind Suzune-san touching me, but I didn't know how to understand my own feelings.  But Suzune-san was kind, like my mother, so I thought it was okay."


Suzune froze at Yuuta’s words, and then the police officers entered the room.


"Hearing Yuuta-sama's words, my mind went blank. Then, after I was arrested, I finally understood. Yuuta-sama… Yuuta-sama was looking for his mother's kindness… so, my crime is a fact. I committed a crime."


Tears streamed down Yuuta's face.


"I… I'm a coward.  I hid in my room, relying on the kind Tomoe-san. I thought if I just stayed quiet and cowered, I'd be forgiven again… Hearing that Suzune-san didn't say anything about me during the trial, I felt relieved… But Suzune-san received a life sentence… I was afraid that if I told the truth, I'd also face a severe punishment… so…"


Yuuta's tears flowed freely, down his cheeks. Aoi and Yukishiro wiped them away with handkerchiefs.


"Suzune-san… I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  You… you were supposed to be my mother. Because of me…"
"Yuuta-sama… I… I committed a crime… uu… I…"


Yuuta and Suzune’s sobs echoed. The others were silent about the truth of the incident, but Riris spoke.


"The suppressed memories were released in response to Suzune-san… and Aoi-sama's calls… and your consciousness returned."
"…Yes. I remember hearing voices in the darkness."


They hadn’t told Aoi and the others about the personality transplant.  Following Yuuta's explanation that he'd blocked the painful memory, Riris continued.


"Yuuta-sama, you collapsed while watching the fireworks at the class trip. What was the cause?"
"At that time… I saw Naoto… and it reminded me of my mother. Of our separation."
"I see.  Your mother and Suzune-san, they were connected, like a single line. With the memories of Suzune-san suppressed, the strong emotional stimulation of your memories of your mother caused you to lose consciousness."


Riris wasn't wrong, but she'd omitted part of the truth.


"It's wonderful that you've awakened. Suzune-san, thank you for your cooperation. Yuuta-sama, you'll stay here tonight. We'll prepare some liquid food."
"What!?"
"We'll conduct various examinations after your awakening."
"That will be done at the hospital."
"That's fine. But I, as a doctor, will also examine Yuuta-sama after his awakening. If it can't be done tonight… we'll have to ask Yuuta-sama to come back later?"
"Oh, uh…"
"Aoi-san. He’ll rest quietly here tonight."
"Y-yes…"


Yuuta sensed that Riris and the other hooded woman wanted to speak privately. And the examination would also be true.


"Suzune-san… I don't know what I can do right now… but I'll tell the country the truth."
"That…"
"Tomoe-san."
"Yes."
"What I just said… if it’s true, would Suzune-san's trial outcome change?"
"Suzune-san did commit the act. But I think there's ample room for consideration."
"I don't know what to do. Can I leave it to you?"
"Leave it to me."


He entrusted the matter of Suzune to Tomoe.


"Aoi-san, Yukishiro-san."
"“Yes.”"
"I'll be back after Riris-san's examination, so don't worry."
"“Yes!”"
"I'm sorry for worrying Nanase-san too."
"We're truly relieved you're awake."
"Ayaka-san… Manami-san… Moe-san…"


He still couldn’t understand why Leila, still being watched by Moe, and the other woman resembling Riris were there.


"Yuuta-sama has awakened safely. Let's end it here for tonight."


After Riris spoke, Leila was the first to move.  She whispered something only Riris could hear and swiftly left.  "We’re waiting for the suitable donor's sperm," she murmured.


Leila took Leila with her and left the room. After that, Aoi and the others left too. Ayaka seemed to want to say something to Yuuta, but she left the room with Tomoe and Suzune.


Yuuta and Riris were left alone in the room.
