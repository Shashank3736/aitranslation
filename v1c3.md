# My Q&A Corner♪
---
I aim to post around 8 PM every night. Daily posts are difficult, but I'll do my best, so please support me with likes and positive feedback!
A week and three days have passed since I made a secret account. My follower count is growing steadily, and all the photos I've posted have been well-received. However, since it's only muscle photos, it lacks variety. Should I try something bolder, like cosplay or nude photos, or branch out into a different genre? Though, my profile picture itself is already cosplay-level.

Incidentally, I've surpassed 3500 followers. There's still plenty of room for growth, and thanks to various people spreading my account, my recognition is steadily increasing. I can't really imagine what 3500 followers looks like, but many people are happy, so there's no problem. So far, I haven't had any stalker incidents.

It's also spread somewhat at school. I secretly saw a girl sending pictures from my secret account to someone. Incidentally, nobody has realized it's me. I thought I might get discovered at the pool, but I didn't. That's because this high school has gender-segregated swimming classes.

And it seems like none of the male students know about my secret account. Even if they did, I think they're keeping it secret, so it probably won't get out. Anyway, setting that aside, the post that got the most engagement was a picture of me doing a *kabe-don* (wall-bang). By the way, I decided to only wear the hood in my profile picture; I took it off in other photos and the response was amazing.

I received 245 comments and 4800 likes. People said it made them feel like we were a couple, or vice versa! So, *kabe-don* is something girls do? This is quite a carnivorous world.

By the way, apparently, male nipples are considered erotic. But the most erotic part is when they're barely visible. So I've tried various poses, like unbuttoning my shirt completely, and fulfilling requests. It's so much fun, I've become addicted to my secret account. That was a long story, but it brings me back to the beginning.

I've also received requests for video posts, but I don't have any equipment. I don't have a lot of savings, so I can't afford it. Should I get a part-time job? Separately, I've been wanting to take more provocative photos lately, but I'm not quite sure how to stimulate women in this world. Should I go for nude photos? I'll set a limit with one sentence.

"Q&A with Shin Koi – Answers will be posted at night."

I posted this in the afternoon and will answer the questions at night. I thought this kind of thing would be nice once in a while. It's also a way to understand what my viewers like, or so I think. But I'm not expecting much.

Then, around the same time I posted the limit at school, I heard a Rimitter notification sound. I wondered if it might be a follower from my secret account. I have notifications turned off because they'd never stop if I turned them on.

The girls who saw it gathered together, whispering about the questions, and typing on their smartphones. Smartphone use isn't prohibited at this school, though it's forbidden during class and will result in confiscation. It's allowed during breaks.

Classes continued as usual. But it's the end of June, and final exams start at the beginning of July. I'm already concentrating on my studies. I initially thought I'd stop the secret account, but I get this compulsive urge, so I'm managing it by switching it on and off.

Classes that are mostly finished are now self-study time for exam preparation. I'm quite smart. Or rather, I work hard. In fact, I built this physique by working hard in club activities, and academics are important too. Incidentally, I'm not in any clubs in high school.

At first, I thought I'd join one, but I get tired of cooking after club activities. Cooking when you're exhausted is hell. Considering that, I didn't join any clubs. I might join one if I have more free time, but honestly, it feels too late now, so I probably won't.

Time passed, and I went home on my usual route. But today I took a detour to the supermarket. It was a sale day, so the meat was cheap. I'll make hamburgers tonight. I put the meat and ingredients in the refrigerator and started preparing dinner.

I spent almost two hours cooking. Making dinner and also making ready-made hamburgers for lunch boxes took longer than I expected. But the result was excellent. I couldn't help but smile. Oh, that's right. I took a picture and posted it on my secret account.

"Tonight's dinner is hamburgers!"

"Looks delicious!"
"You can cook? I can't."
"You're basically my husband."
"Marry me!"
"I'm hungry at work now."

I tried a different approach, and this also seemed popular. So far, there haven't been many anti-fans. There were a few, though. Their comments were things like, "Creepy, uncool," "So? You want attention?" and "Womanizer." Frankly, I don't care, and I don't need to reply. My fans would attack them anyway, so they disappear without me having to do anything.

I cut into the hamburger with a knife. By the way, it's not just any hamburger, it's a cheese-stuffed hamburger. I love cheese. I often order cheese-stuffed hamburgers at family restaurants. I made this one based on those.

"Hmm, it's really good. I want to try more types of cheese, but it'll be expensive."

After cleaning up, taking a bath, and doing laundry, I open my secret account. I prioritize housework first, then my secret account. In my mind, it's a hobby, not a job.

It's 8 PM, and it's already late at night. But this is my free time. It's time to answer the questions I posted in the afternoon. I opened Rimitter and looked at the replies to my Q&A post. Wow, I got a lot of replies. About 400, I think. Having many followers is nice, but it's inconvenient in this way.

(I can't reply to all of these.)

"I'll compile the answers into one post."

I started to organize the questions on a piece of paper. Unfortunately, I don't have a PC, only a smartphone. It's inconvenient in situations like this. Okay, let's see the first question...

"Are you a womanizer?"
"No."

"Do you have any experience with women?"
"No."

"Do you use protein powder or steroids?"
"No."

"How many times a day do you masturbate?"
"It depends on the day."

"Is that your real hair?"
"It's a wig to prevent identification."

"Why don't you take off your mask?"
"I might, if there's an opportunity."

"How long is your penis?"
"I'll leave that to your imagination."

"Why don't you do video posts?"
"I don't have the equipment or the mental preparation."

"I want to hear you sing."
"I'll try that soon."

"What camera are you using?"
"My smartphone."

Hmm, most of the questions are just blatant expressions of desire. It's all about their ulterior motives. I skipped similar questions. I was hesitant about hiding my face with a mask, but many people said things like, "The mystery is good," or "It's okay if it's for preventing identification." Then I found a question.

"Why don't you use Amazon's gift function?"

Amazon is supposed to be one of the world's largest online retailers. But I don't know about its gift function. I tapped on my smartphone and searched for "Amazon gift function". It seems like it's a function that allows you to anonymously send gifts without knowing the recipient's address.

I looked it up online and created a new link for the gift function so people could send things to my house. If my parents were home, I wouldn't have done it, but mostly it's just me, so it should be fine. However, I'm actually looking forward to seeing how many gifts I get. I also created a new dedicated account on Amazon.

I mostly finished answering the questions. I was also asked things like, "Do you have any intention of meeting people in person?" or "Do you have any plans for an offline meetup?" An offline meetup... that feels like a stage too far for me right now. I'm still a minor. At least after high school. Even if I did it in high school, it would be better if it was with someone around my age.

My reply was, "I don't have the courage yet," and "At least after high school, or someone around the same age." But considering that people might lie about their age to target me for an offline meetup, I probably won't do it until after high school. But if I'm tempted, I'll probably give in to my desires. Absolutely. Especially if the other person is attractive and beautiful. Then I posted a summary of the questions and answers.

"The questions were hilarious!"
"I'm surprised you don't have much experience."
"That muscle definition without protein or steroids is amazing."
"↑Protein isn't a steroid, lol."
"↑It's a joke, lol. Get it."
"That silver hair is a wig. You'd probably look good in cosplay."
"Leave it to your imagination... meaning it's big."
"People who are just looking for a hookup should look in the mirror."
"How much would it cost for an offline meetup with a slim, muscular, handsome guy...?"
"The gift function is unlocked! Send me gifts!"

It seems to be lively, which is good. But the lack of equipment is still a problem. Maybe I should start a part-time job soon? But part-time jobs are forbidden at my school. So, I'll have to rely on the gift function. I set a timer and did a high kick at the right moment.

Despite my appearance, I used to practice martial arts for a while. The reason was to move faster and more realistically in fight scenes for a play. I also developed flexibility, so I'm quite flexible. That's why I can kick very high. Then I checked the photo.

"Oh, I succeeded on the first try; I got lucky. And it looks pretty good."

In the photo of my high kick, my leg was raised to its limit, and my abs and navel were slightly visible through the gap in my slightly loose T-shirt. It's a navel and abs reveal. The slightly lifted shirt adds to the dynamic feel. I decided to post it.

"Cool!!!"
"I want to be kicked."
"So flexible!"
"Navel reveal aaaaaahhhhh!"
"You look like you can fight."
"You look like you could beat up anyone who sexually harasses you."

Compared to the erotic content, the engagement was lower, but it still did well. Surprisingly, the accidental revealing type of photos were quite popular. Many comments said that it made me look even cooler. Being called cool as a man is very satisfying. Since I have school tomorrow, I decided to end the day early, brushed my teeth, and went to bed.

That day's photo got 4000 likes, 800 comments, and my followers exceeded 10,000. Incidentally, my notifications wouldn't stop, so I turned them off immediately.
Hamburgers!!!

Reminds me of a certain comedian...
