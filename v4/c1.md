**Episode 1: April - Third Year of High School**

April arrived, marking the beginning of Yuuta's third year of high school.

For boys, the third year of high school often means less interaction with girls and more personal time to relax. This is because the girls are usually busy preparing for university entrance exams. While it's not like all interaction with girls disappears, compared to the first and second years, boys find themselves with significantly more free time.

However, Yuuta was different.

It wasn't because he was busy preparing for a wedding in July. Yoshihara and Minato were likely swamped with preparations for Aoi and Yukishiro's joint wedding. But Yuuta had little to prepare himself. He had entrusted all the wedding preparations to Yoshihara and Minato. His role was simply to decide on things like the wedding dress and rings with Aoi and Yukishiro, all while enjoying some sweet moments together.

The reason Yuuta was busy was similar to that of the girls: he was studying. Yuuta had chosen the rare path for a maleâ€”he wanted to attend university. His goal was to become a teacher in the Special District, which would begin full-scale management starting April of the following year. The Prime Minister had asked him to become the homeroom teacher for Naoto and the others, but Yuuta decided to take on the role of assistant teacher instead, allowing him to spend time with Naoto and his friends when he had the chance. A woman with a teaching license would take the homeroom teacher position. Yuuta's ultimate goal was to become the homeroom teacher when Naoto and the others entered middle school.

Because Yuuta wished to attend university, a new university was being established just for him. This university aimed to deepen research on child education and parent-child relationships by inviting experts from various fields as lecturers. It would study not only the relationship between mothers and sons but also mothers and daughters, as well as fathers and children. What Yuuta would learn at this university would greatly aid him in managing the Special District.

Like the girls, Yuuta was diligently studying, but unlike them, he didn't have to take university entrance exams. Since the university was being created specifically for him, his enrollment was already guaranteed. Girls in Yuuta's class who wished to attend this new university could do so through a recommendation system. Aoi, Manami, and Akari were three who would be attending the university through this recommendation. Yukishiro, however, would not be attending university, as she would be marrying and taking on the role of the head of the Minato Eitaka family. Instead, she would continue her studies by inviting tutors to the estate.

Moe was preparing to take the entrance exam for a prestigious university with a medical school, as she aspired to become a doctor and manage Yuuta's health. Other girls were also studying hard for their desired universities. Although the new university was being established for Yuuta, it didn't mean the girls' paths would change. They believed that while being by Yuuta's side was appealing, walking their own paths firmly was what would make them attractive to him. They trusted that even if physical distance separated them as they worked hard, Yuuta was not the type of man to lose the affection he had cultivated over the three years of high school.

Tomoe, who had become Yuuta's girlfriend, was spending more time as the class homeroom teacher, focusing on the girls. While she handled her duties as Yuuta's supervising officer, she left being by Yuuta's side to Ayaka. Ayaka had taken a leave of absence from the Male Supervision Division 2 at the end of March, so she had plenty of time to serve as Yuuta's personal secretary.

Yuuta continued to balance his studies with community service, just as actively as before. His days were a whirlwind of studying, community service, interacting with the 55 girls in his class, spending time with Tomoe and Ayaka, other social engagements, and a bit of wedding preparation. Aoi and the others, while concerned about Yuuta's health, supported him as he worked hard toward his goals. The mysterious headaches he used to suffer from were gone, and with no unknown factors causing anxiety, they could fully support his efforts.

Moreover, being able to comfort a tired Yuuta brought them great happiness. When a weary Yuuta showed his vulnerable side, it triggered the girls' maternal instincts. While a strong and reliable Yuuta was admirable, a Yuuta who showed his softer side was equally endearing.

There were essentially no major events in the third year of high school. If the boys wished for something, the girls would make it happen, but Yuuta made sure not to interfere with the girls' studies. The only exception was a class evening party planned for November. The preparations for the party would be handled with the help of Yoshihara and Minato, so it wouldn't take up the girls' time. Yuuta hoped it would serve as a break from their exam preparations. Of course, he planned to gift dresses to everyone.

No matter how much time they had, it never felt like enough. In the midst of this limited time, Yuuta cherished the bonds he had with the important people in his life. And so, this year would become one of deepening those precious connections.
