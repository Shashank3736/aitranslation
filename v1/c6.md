The incident happened suddenly.
The word count is around 3500-4500, so it might not feel very substantial, but I'd be happy if you enjoyed it.

“Look at me properly! Look at me *properly*!”

“Wow, Maihua-san, you can sing!”

“I get totally absorbed every time I hear it.”

“You could easily be on a singing contest!”

Maihua-san, a regular at this karaoke box, possessed a truly remarkable voice honed by daily practice (or play). Her voice, clear as a bell—unbelievable for a gal—perfectly conveyed the meaning of the heartbreak song she was singing. I personally felt, not so much the sadness of heartbreak, but a strong resonance with the feeling of regret. I’d been feeling quite horny just moments before, but Maihua-san's singing had a cleansing effect.

And the score? An astonishing 98! That’s way too high! It's almost professional level. This karaoke box uses a recently popular AI scoring system, which is apparently very difficult to get a high score on. In that context, this high score is, in a sense, monstrous. I applauded, encompassing both the vocal performance and the score itself. Also, there was a certain gap—a delightful incongruity—between her image as a "gal" and her singing a heartbreak song.

“Oh, I'm so embarrassed.”

“No, you're amazing. Seriously.”

“Hehe, thanks.”

Maihua-san's bright smile was dazzling. Her pure smile made me want to punch myself for having even considered her "sexy" just a moment before. Then, she slumped down heavily into the seat directly opposite me. I might have used the fastest thinking and most intense concentration of my life. I didn't miss the fleeting moment her skirt lifted as she sat down. I saw a light blue fabric and matching light blue straps at her crotch area.

(Light blue! And string panties?! Do girls our age wear this kind of thing nowadays? Or is it because my libido is high that I notice such things? Or maybe it's just comfortable?)

I didn't want to stare, so I pretended to take a sip of my juice. Furthermore, Maihua-san was sprawled out with her legs quite open. Her panties were clearly visible. Everyone else seemed to see it too, but she didn't seem to mind at all.

Next up was Matsura-san. I was curious what song she would sing. Would it be a popular J-POP song? She'd already selected her song, and it began. What followed was a booming sound—drums and guitars that could be described as deafening—followed by Matsura-san's yell.

“YEEEEEEEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!”

“I didn’t expect a rock band song.”

“She’s a huge fan of the Turtles, you know.”

“A strong impact, completely different from Maihua-san.”

I’d heard of the Turtles. Because “turtles” translates directly to “kame” (亀) in Japanese, people tend to assume they are a slow-paced band, but quite the opposite; they’re famous for their intense music. I’d heard online that they're an all-female band that embodies the cries of women's hearts. Whether that's true or not, I don't know.

Her pitch was slightly off at times, but I felt there was a unique Matsura-san originality in her performance. Singing with your own original rhythm and pitch, regardless of the score, is one of the joys of karaoke. She scored 88 points, not quite reaching 90, but it was still a high score. And, of course, there was the charm of Matsura-san’s unique style of singing that couldn't be expressed in a mere score.

“It's not just her vocal ability, it's her… volume.”

“Amazing, right?”

“She's a good singer, but you can't help but notice *that*.”

“Tha-anks.”

“Your voice is hoarse!”

It's no wonder her throat was sore after singing such loud, high-pitched rock music. We got her some water and had her take a short break. Next was Uchimiya-san. Judging from the gap between the previous two singers' song choices, maybe she’d sing enka (traditional Japanese ballad)? No, maybe something more common? Or maybe an anime song! No, wait, maybe Western music? The more I thought about it, the more I had no idea what Uchimiya-san would sing.

“Even grief and pain in bygone days♪”

“Uh, which category does that even fall into?”

Uchimiya-san was singing a J-POP song in English. Why?! But she was a great singer, and her English was natural and somehow made it sound like a completely different song. No way, even if she’s smart, being fluent in English is a bit unfair… in many ways. And why is she singing in English? She's amazing, though.

“Rio's confused.”

“Well, it is a surprise at first.”

“I just do it because I can study English and enjoy singing at the same time.”

“Seriously? You should loosen up a bit when you're having fun.”

Uchimiya-san finished her song, and the score appeared: 92 points. How does she get such a high score singing in a different language? I was starting to feel overwhelmed by their beautiful voices.

“Sanada-kun! It’s your turn!”

I took the microphone, took a deep breath, and started singing along to the intro. I often sing along to songs on my phone while doing housework, so I could sing without feeling too embarrassed. But I was still nervous and uncertain about how good I actually was.

“The voice of the sky I long to hear♪”

“Wow, great voice.”

“Usually your voice is low, but when you sing it’s husky.”

“…”

After I finished singing, there was a moment of silence. I thought I’d been terrible, but it seemed they had been completely engrossed in my singing. Good! I’d been so nervous since it was my first time at karaoke. I thought my singing might be so bad they wouldn’t even know how to give feedback.

After that, we just enjoyed karaoke normally. We competed for scores, had penalty games, did impressions, sang duets, and so on. It was my first time at karaoke, but I think I’m going to get hooked. Actually, I’m definitely going to get hooked. Once I get some decent equipment, I might even try posting a "song cover" video. But I’ll have to deal with copyright issues first.

(However…)

I realized something. I'm not insensitive; I tend to notice things to a certain extent. Two pairs of eyes. There were only four of us, and Maihua-san was singing, so there's no need to say their names, but it was Matsura-san and Uchimiya-san. Matsura-san seemed to be plotting something.

Uchimiya-san was staring intently at me, seemingly lost in thought. What? Did she fall for me? No way. Uchimiya-san, the top student everyone admires, falling for me? No way. I've never heard rumors of her having a boyfriend, so she's probably focused on her club activities and studies. That kind of person… it's said that people like that are the ones most likely to… could it be possible?

“I’m going to wash my hands.”

“Okay.”

I left the room to go to the restroom. The restroom was down this corridor, then right, wasn't it? I walked down the corridor. To the left was the single-stall restroom, and to the right were the men's and women's restrooms. A security camera was installed on the ceiling a little further back.

Then I realized something. Aside from the security camera, the men's restroom usually comes before the women's as a security measure in my previous world. But here, it was the other way around; the women's restroom was first, and the men's was further back.

(In a world with reversed gender roles, this kind of thing happens. I almost unconsciously went for the one in the front.)

I almost committed a sex crime. Just as I was about to pass the women’s restroom, someone suddenly grabbed my arm and dragged me inside.

“Wha-?!”

I was so surprised I couldn't react, lost my balance, and was pulled into a stall. Everything happened incredibly fast. It was like whoever it was knew this restroom perfectly. And they were quite strong. I was forced to sit on the toilet, pinned against the wall, and a phone screen was shoved in my face. It was a picture from my secret account.

“This photo… is that you?”

A familiar voice. It was Matsura-san, always bright and cheerful. But she looked like a wicked woman, plotting something, trying to corner me with evidence. But it was definitely Matsura-san. The problem was that my secret account had been exposed. I tried to play dumb.

“What are you talking about? And is this even allowed? It’s a crime.”

“Don't change the subject, and I'm not easily fooled. And I won't let a body I've got my eye on escape.”

“Uh… got your eye on?”

“The muscles in this arm clearly match the photo.”

(Ignoring that?!)

She then showed me a picture of an arm. It did indeed match my arm. Because it *was* my arm. And it was the same arm she’d requested earlier. I could have fought back, but hurting a classmate, especially a girl, even under threat, felt wrong.

“Let me ask you again. Is this you?”

“…What if it is?”

“Don't give me vague answers. Tell me clearly.”

“It’s me. So what?”

Was she going to threaten me into becoming her slave or errand boy? No, this world is a world with reversed gender roles. Maybe she'd exploit my weakness and demand payment in kind. Well, being told that by a beauty like Matsura-san wasn’t unpleasant. But I'd rather not have it spread around! I might lose my place at school!

“I see…”

Then she released her grip from the wall, freeing me from the wall-pinning. She took a deep breath.

“I like you! Will you go out with me?”

“…Huh?”

She offered her hand, bowed, and confessed her love. In the women's restroom… The chaotic situation was too much for my brain to process.
